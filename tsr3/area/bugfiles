#ROOMDATA
#23200
The Lair of the Beast~
You appear in a room filled with silence.  As you look around you are
filled with horror as you witness the birth of pain and suffering in the
heart of the realm.  The floors are smooth to the touch but you can feel the
heat pulsing from the hell below.  Your organs ache at the stench of evil
and your head clouds as you view a place of unholiness and torment.  You
have entered the Lair of Annibus.  The beast has returned to the realm to
wreak havok on the souls of dominion.

Entrance to the Dominion of Torment~
You have travelled through time and space to a void that does not feel
like your own.  This dimension places you in the Dominion of Torment.  A
place where pain is for the noble and suffering beckons you at every moment.
As a member of this brotherhood of evil you may enter the Dominion at your
leisure.  But if you are a child of light then prepare to behold your
nightmares for you have entered a realm that will make your soul curse and
bleed from its essence.  "WELCOME TO TORMENT!!!!"

Display of Damnation~
Your pulse lumps in your throat as you witness the birth of pain and
suffering.  Minions of evil are here ravishing the souls of the realm. 
Corpses are strewn throughout this room with various defects mangeling there
once beautiful complections.  This is the Display of Damnation....  A place
where you do not wish to linger.  The guards before you beckon you to move
along or be consumed.

The Pain of the Gods~
This room is filled with gruesome murals of beings going through some
sort of struggle.  Upon closer inspection you realize that these are
immortals suffering!  The mural is filled with anguish that makes your
bowels hollow.  This is the pain of the Gods.  You trudge into ankle deep
blood created by the weeping immortals on the walls.  There are others in
this room that are tending to the murals as if there were living creatures
in them.  What you do not realize is that they are tending to the souls of
mortals to make the gods suffer!

The Abyssmal Gateway~
Heat singes your face immediatly followed by a blast of frost.  You enter
a room with a huge void in the center.  This vortex is made up of an energy
that you have never seen before.  The blue material swirls into an unknown
abyss The sound of souls passing through this gate is deafening but you feel
at peace.  This is your own personal hell.  You can witness the eternal
damnation for your own eyes and know the reason you have entered this sacred
sect.

Way of the Lost~
In this same passage you feel your soul beginning to slip through your
grasp. You feel somber as you look at the rest of this area. Will you ever
be the same after being in here?  The way of the lost is the way for the
damned. And you'd be damned to witness this silent torture any longer.

Intersection to the Passage of Silence~
Here you stand in a place of complete silence. Nothing can be heard not
even your own breath or heart. Are you dead?  Or does this place have a
control over you that you have never felt. You want so terribly to just lie
down and sleep....ah..sleep. But if you sleep, will you ever wake up?

Passage of Silence~
The silence is still deafening in this corridor as you attempt to hurry
on your way. You see other murals here of mortals screaming but no sound
escapes their lips as they move through the scene of horror. You look to
your east and see a closed door with a dull blue glow emerging from its
edges. You wish to get away from the silence...anything to hear again!

Passage of Silence~
You become accustomed to the silence but only enough to keep your sanity.
The walls here glow in a faint blue and seem to hum without sound. You
notice the passageway sloping down ever so slightly and see a doorway up
ahead. To the east you see a bright red light beaming from a cracked stone
doorway. There is a sign above the way that looks to say T...M..T...ED A.L.

Entrance to the Elder Tomb of Torment~
You have entered what might be called a "holy" place of torment. This is
the tomb of the elders of this great sect. Inside you will find the areas
for the High Council and other great Tormenters. Do not enter unguarded for
there could be a member that does not wish you to intrude on their sacred
ground.

happen. Grathon is here to use his power taken from the lost souls of this
realm to boost the members of his sect. Pay no attention to the slaughter
you see before you for it makes you feel complete .

Nevertheless, the place is one that you can sit and tell your war stories of
despair.  Choose your drink wisely in this place for ya never know what
might be in 'em!
