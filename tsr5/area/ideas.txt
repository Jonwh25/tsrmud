[  857] Cyrion: a scan command!
[ 1284] DaLMoR: make help files for the stats, so you know what they modify.
[  820] Cyrion: newbie gear
[25007] Cyrion: a moneychanger, exchange x amount of copper for x amount of silver
[ 8063] Saridon: Have the spel-casting classes (mage, cleric, necromancer, psion) get a meditate skill for mana recovery
[ 1325] Cyrion: an mob that id's items for a price
[ 1300] Phalas: since wearwolves are part dog, I think they should be able to see in the dark. maybe make that a skill or something
[ 5030] Cyrion: fast healing for warriors!
[25006] Cyrion: MOUNTS!
[10915] Cyrion: blood trails should lead in a certain direction
[25000] Phalas: give a help file on the conversions of the currency.
[25000] Cerin: a heal for pay healer
[25001] Phalas: how about having a command where you can pick which song you want to play without saying it(like what i have to). the syntax can be "play <filename> <# ot times>". Though I don't think this is nessesary, I think it would be easier.
[25000] Phalas: When you pick your class and race, how about doing it at the same time, so you know what class you want to be and know the races that can be that class.
[25000] Phalas: List the max stats for each race.
[25000] Phalas: how about a carry commmand? you can carry someone at double your move, good if they ran out if them.
[25000] Cerin: maby some more damage levels..prehasp spread it out some..so that at higher levels you don't get tired ot seeing diferent messages..maby add lots of color
[  930] Phalas: how about disease be contageous, from airbourn(everyone in the room is infected) to nonairbourn(just if you touch the person you get infected). and when you get infected, it is half of the infected person.
[25008] Cyrion: a NEWBIE channel
[  841] Deven: layout of mudschool needs to be more logical. Gotta remember to make a new one
[25087] Cerin: how about making palm n auto skill..if the dex is high enough to use
[ 8768] Cerin: bas
[ 1272] Zorax: I just want to get the Shocking Grasp spell back to mages... Or replace it with another spell... Thanks, Zorax
[  823] Ghenghir: There should be a spell to replace shocking grasp. Now druids kinda suck
[ 1300] Trey: I was wondering if they have Clan houses? If not, what about the possibility of having them available with the option for upgrading them. For instance, Clan members could pool their money to get the Clan Hall and then later buy guards, an oracle(loa
[ 1300] Trey: This would not only promote more rivalry between Clans, but also a chance for players to have ownership and to have to defend the House. There are alot of possibilities and I know your busy with the spells/skills, but I thought I'd just offer an ide
[ 1351] Ghenghir: I think the old practice system is more realistic... maybe each time you should gain only 1 exp for each time you cast though or something if you think it would be tougher... If you dont want that, at least give us many more practice points than wha
[14550] Saridon: since paladins are clerical in nature how about a cure blindness spell added to the spell list. (low priority)
[20203] Krin: works
[10209] Cerin: vial
[ 4602] Zorax: I would just like the Shocking Grasp back for mages... You guys put it back then just now took it away... Im sorry to disturb you... Thanks, Zorax
[23904] Cerin: sun
[10177] Cerin: claw
[10649] Zorax: Immortals... shouldn't bards have Charm Person? I dunno... maybe they are good enough as they are. Just a thought
[ 4626] Zorax: I know you guys do the best you can but no Immortals are on that much anymore....
[10682] Cyrus: claw
[ 9572] Daxon: I don't like Yrinthi's idea, and I don't think 40-80 hp is a waste either.
[ 9572] Daxon: I was wondering if you'd taken off summon, and when (if) we'll get it back.
[  810] Varnath: shell
[  808] Varnath: shell
[10134] Amergin: 00 silver
[10645] Zorax: I know of a spell that is causing a really bad crash! It is the identify spell. Im not sure about the scroll. I just wanna tell you guys are doin a great job and I know you will do the best you can. Thanks, Zorax
[ 9583] Daxon: I think you should put the stats along with the level of the weapon being auctioned
[ 5139] Daxon: We need a numerical readout of our hunger, because when we get hungry, we lose hp, and we could prevent that precisely if we could see our hunger.
[10608] Zorax: arm
[10643] Zorax: talon
[10694] Zorax: Im sorry Immortals but my aliases are not working and that was identify... Again I am very sorry...

[20220] Arakius: bamboo
[25031] Arakius: holy
[25000] Azygwl: could group command show xp to next level, rather than total xp?

[ 1399] Durvin: How about a carry skill for warriors?  They could carry exhausted people on their back, but they would have to be able to support the weight.
[ 1282] Drakin: I have an idea for a spell: Disrupt   it could be the same as Shocking grasp or not as much damage as that, but it would have an affect on stats or something...
[ 4607] Durvin: Eternal intellect needs a help file.
[ 4607] Durvin: anatomy knowledge needs a help file.
[ 4607] Durvin: Pardon, anatomy knowledge does NOT need a help file.
[    4] Beowolf: JAIL!
[ 5122] Azygwl: make a command "ic" which takes you back from the ooc lounge to the room you were in last... :) 
[ 9590] Azygwl: add an (ooc) flag before peoples names on the who list..
[25000] Dalmor: How about limiting people kinds(class and race) of people who can worship a god or join a sect. Like not allowing demons to join rebellion.
[11101] Azygwl: bracer
[11101] Azygwl: sorry!!!
[25000] Azygwl: how about an otell command for ooc tell??
[25000] Azygwl: if possible, can we turn off the grat channel? same as the info channel... (really cool would be info channel=off override if sender is immortal or system)

[25000] Dalmor: How about making some NPC's aggressive toward a certain race and maybe even a class.
[  818] Junkus: have the max % for each skill. I don't like have the same max % for all the skills.
[  812] Junkus: how about making a few races unable to bleed, like shadows or demons. So they won't leave a trail.
[25000] Vandyr: make a way to look at someone and just get description, not all their worn eq.. would help with roleplay too.
[  848] Krin: gem
[  810] Vandyr: could the practice at the trainer listing only show the ones you have yet to practice??? (or "practice new" option??)
[25025] Fain: ring

[25000] Dalmor: make an anti-paladin...good for rp'ing

[ 8768] Vordan: please can we have a way to turn off the grat channel?
[26024] Vordan: have the time for corpse explosion depend upon level.. (hopefully it already does?)
[26033] Vordan: its kinda bad for roleplay to see "you must be level xx to wear that".. cant ya make it something less number oriented? maybe like close, someday, outclassed??
[20222] Vorn: breeches
[20222] Vorn: cloak
[20228] Vordan: can ya put save vs breath into the score along with save vs spell?? damn dragons..
[11841] Vordan: for a spell that fails so much, turn has a high mana cost :) 100?? more than a golden aura? cant it get dropped down to 50, maybe?
[25000] Yisheng: is the a spell call fiest or party? maybe it would be nice to have cleric and paladins being able to create lots of foods and drinks
[25000] Vordan: please include bank account money on worth??
[11206] Vordan: auction also displays the level # of the item.. kinda breaks with rp.. could ya change it to be one of 10 options depending on which 10 level group its from?

[25001] Vordan: I had mentioned afore about taking out the level # shown in auction. Perhaps a more elegant fix would be to only show you auctioned items if they are of a level you could use.
[ 2972] Vordan: when you animate a corpse, could any of its contents spill out onto the ground, instead of vanishing into the ether?
[ 2710] Vordan: a "target" command or skill that lets you pick which of the many attacking mobs you want to be hitting...
[25073] Vordan: how about a way to set odds during challenges :)
[ 5100] Raywal: ring
[25000] JyKarath: 100 copper
[10668] Lybock: How about a 'fast' skill for monks, allowing them to go long periods without food?
[ 9044] Vordan: a prison... you can push someone in, and its a no recall room. mob will hold them there the number of ticks that they are paid to do so. limit of say 20 or something.. Also a peaceful room.
[10176] Fulstyr: Bring Back True Sight... and Death Field for the Psionist.... (the help file says that death field is for Psionists)
[10176] Fulstyr: Mobs should be better at disarm... and more max xps for grouped chars
[11240] Fulstyr: A Extending mana spell......same as dark blessing or aid but adds +mana max

[25000] Vordan: how about having the hero help files available at level 99, so you can tell what you are going to be getting into??
[14000] Vordan: a way to become vis without fighting from phaseshift and invis.. (visable command??)
