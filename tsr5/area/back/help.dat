code is based on was written by Surreality and installed in The Isles by Locke.
It was then converted to work with Envy by Jason Dinkel, and ported to ROM
by Hans Birkeland (Hugin).
 
Inside an editor, typing COMMANDS lists working commands and ? gives
help. AEDIT and REDIT default to the current area or room. EDIT ROOM RESET
resets the current room.  Most commands with no arguments display syntax.

0 LAG~
Do Not Complain About Lag over OOC or in Notes. It is not the mud's fault
that you are experiencing Lag.  The mud is run on a 100 Megabyte line and is
under constant monitoring to assure that no problems occur (such as lag).
More than likely if you are experiencing lag, it is either a SprintLink
connection problem, or your own ISP.  If you have any questions about this,
do a traceroute, or go to the website mudservices.com  and they will be
more than happy to do one for you.  If we see continual postings on OOC
or in notes, it will result in immortal punishment.  First time is a 
guaranteed warning, after that...it depends on what immortal you are dealing 
with, and how pissed off he or she is.  In other words, DON'T DO IT.

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example, if you are equipping a mobile, don't load a container in the 
room and fill it with some objects and then continue equipping the mobile.
It is likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.

Immortal Rules/Guidelines
-------------------------
 
We, as immortals, are here to insure that our world runs with a minimal amount
  of distress and anarchy. To those ends here is a list of _Do's_and_Dont's_.

=============================================================================
   *DO NOT use your imm powers to aid in the pkilling of those characters who
    either your sect members don't like, or you don't like. 

The above may be changed/added to so check this entry often review it sometime

Failure to adhere to the rules will result in a trial run, and made up of your
superiors.  Those superiors may choose to do any of the following as a 
punsihment.

- temporary demotion to a lower imm level
- temporary revocation of your imm powers  
- permanent demotion to level 1           
- removal of your char        

Brought to you by the Administrators of TSR                      
We reserve the right to modify these guidelines at any point in time
or to render them null and void.
~

-1 ACCEPT~
Type accept when a player is challenging someone to fight in the arena.
You cannot accept a challenge while in hell or jail, or fighting. 
If you have the required amount of coins being challenged, you will both
be transported to the arena.

See also: ARENA CHALLENGE
~

-1 SCRY~
Scry is a spell which once cast, allows you to see into rooms directly
around you.  Type cast 'scry' to use. Once casted, if you type look
north, then it will look into the room to the north and show you that room,
who's in it, and what objects are in it.
~

-1 SCHOOL~
Mud School was designed by Hatchet of MERC Industries for any MERC mud.

The purpose of Mud School is to orient new players to the basics of the
game and provide equipment and experience for a few levels.

Experienced players are encouraged to go through Mud School for their
initial levels and equipment.

You may not 'SAVE' your character until your character reaches 2nd level.

You may train your attributes and make them better at the Adept of Furey
one 'NORTH' and one 'WEST' of the Entrance of Mud School.  See 'HELP TRAIN'.

There is also a practice adept one 'NORTH' and one 'EAST' of the Entrance of
Mud School.  You may not practice until your character reaches 3rd level
however.  See 'HELP PRACTICE'.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list  <object>
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.

LIST with no argument lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
LIST <object> lists only the items corresponding with <object> the shop
keeper will sell you.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

BUY, SELL, and VALUE, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if LIST DAGGER showed you that a shopkeeper had five daggers,
and you were interested in buying the third one, you would type:
"buy 3.dagger".
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may buy one more pet each time you
advance in level.  Your pet-buying opportunities do not accumulate; use them or
lose them.  This policy prevents wholesale abuse of pets.

You are responsible for the actions of your pets.  Conversely, if you attack
someone else's pet, you will be penalized as if you attacked them.  It is
a good idea to refrain from attacking creatures labelled '(Charmed)'.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells and SING for bards.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits (try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).  If you have AUTOEXIT set, you
will automatically see the visible exits whenever you walk into a room.
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

COINS being one of gold, silver or copper.
DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET, and PUT, as well as most other object manipulation commands,
allow the use of #.object format, where # is a number or the word "all".
For example, if you had five daggers and you wanted to give the third
one away, you would type "give 3.dagger frag".  Or if you felt 
philanthropic and decided to let everyone eat your pot pies, you could
type "drop all.pie".
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (worn armor, weapons, and held items)
INVENTORY lists your visible inventory/what you are carrying
~

0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KICK KILL MURDER~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: kill     <character>
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

MURDER is used to kill other player characters.  There are restrictions on
murdering low level players, and there are penalties for using MURDER.
You must also MURDER followers/charmed mobiles.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, or KICK successfully, you must practice the
appropriate skill.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK READ~
Syntax: look
Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character>
Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword>
Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container>
Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: read    <keyword>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see.  LOOK by itself will
give the description of the room you are in.  See also BRIEF.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.

READ is the same as LOOK, but it sounds better to 'READ sign' than to
'LOOK sign', doesn't it?
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all         command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm, and
they will no longer follow your orders.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: wake  <character>

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you 
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: ;     <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: '     <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.  You can GTELL no
matter what your own condition is (i.e., sleeping, fighting, mortally wounded).

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote (')
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

You must be awake to SAY or TELL, but you can still REPLY while sleeping.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly. Your class and race may also affect the "wearability" of
any item or piece of equipment.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

50 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

WIZHELP provides a list of all of the immortal commands available to you.
~

0 AREAS COMMANDS SOCIALS~

When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown in the
verb used in the damage message.  Here are all the damage verbs listed from
least damage to most damage:

0 DEATH~
Please read this, and keep all in mind. For short version see "help death2".
When your character dies, you are reincarnated persay. This is, of course,
depending on the level of your character at the time of death.
 
If you die AT or UNDER LEVEL 20, you and your corpse will be transferred to
the morgue. Here you can GET ALL CORPSE and SAVE. You will then have to ENTER
<your portal of choice>. If you are GOOD ALIGNED, you will want to ENTER
BETHAVEN. If you are EVIL ALIGNED, you will most likely choose to ENTER
RAVENWOOD, as it is well-known for its shadowy places. NEUTRAL characters
are welcomed in either of the towns. Of course, you may go to Ravenwood if
you are good aligned, but you will surely pay the price.
 
If you are OVER LEVEL 20 at the time of death, you will be sent to the morgue.
That is, your mind and soul will be transferred to the morgue where it will
have to seek out and find your body to join with once again. Of course, if
you have no luck in finding your corpse you will have to re-equip yourself
with no armour to aid you.
 
The Gods have been known to grant favors for mortals who are reknown for great
deed-doing (helping newbies, and helping others retrieve lost corpses). To
expect such a favor is sacriledge, and to receive one... a great honor.
 
** Any affected_by spells are cancelled upon death.**
**Followers and group members are not affected by death**
**You lose experience points for dying. You lose half-way back to the
  beginning of your level.**
**All followers are lost upon your death. (or theirs)**
***Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last -roughly- 30 hours of MUD time (15 minutes real time). Only
the player who died, or someone in the same group, can retrieve objects from a
player's corpse.***
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need 1000
experience points for each level of experience.

You gain experience by:

    killing monsters
    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~

115 STORY~
One hundred and fifty years ago ...

Nomads from the Great Eastern desert brought spices and slaves to the Thalos
Market.  Dwarven miners, rough and rude, sold precious stones and drank the
town dry of firebreathers.  Stone golems, created by mages from the Tower of
High Sorcery, stood sentry duty in the watch towers.

It was dawn on the Day of Thunder.  The Mayor of Midgaard (great-grand-father
of today's Mayor) arrived early to pay tribute at City Hall.  He entered the
Grand Gate unchallenged.  He found the streets and markets empty.  Seeing a
nearby lamia, he asked her about the residents.  Where were all the people?

The lamia didn't act like a lamia.  Instead of answering him in the helpful but
stupid lamia manner, she stabbed the Mayor with a long, slim dagger.  Other
lamias, hearing the tumult, arrived and attacked.  The Mayor was killed.

Now Thalos is abandoned.  Wild lamias roam the streets, killing intruders and
sacrificing their bodies at the Temple of Thalos.  The golems no longer respond
to command and now watch eternally from their ruined towers.

Midgaard is next.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

When an area resets, you are often notified with what is called the "area
sound". Usually some theme to the area. Again, some areas have no sound and
you will not be physically warned of a reset.
~

0 BUG IDEA TYPO~
Syntax: bug  <message>
Syntax: idea <message>
Syntax: typo <message>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special affects on the objects, so it might
not be completely accurate.  An IDENTIFY spell is more accurate than COMPARE.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character, as well as
a comparison of your relative health. Of course, it's only a rough estimate
and your opponents shields are usually not considered in this comparison.

Sets your personal description. That is, the description that players will see
when they "look" at you. If the description string starts with a '+', the part
after the '+' is appended to your currect description, so that you can make
multi-line descriptions. Of course, the easiest way to make your description
is to simply type DESCRIPTION which will take you into append mode (exactly
the same as writing a note, see HELP NOTE) and you can format your text,
delete lines, insert lines etc. Typing '.h' on a new line in append mode will
give you the help file for append commands.
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be

~

0 WIMPY~

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 AUCTION CHAT . MUSIC QUESTION ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: auction  <message>
Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>

Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

AUCTION, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
interested players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The QUESTION and ANSWER
commands both use the same 'question' channel.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~

0 EMOTE , SOCIALS~
Syntax: emote <action>

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK.

NOTE POST or NOTE SEND posts your note for reading.  Posting is not automatic.

NOTE REMOVE removes the entire note if you are the sender, or just removes you
from the to-list if you are a recipient.

NOTE WRITE allows you to write your whole note without having to do your note
line by line. You can write out the whole note and edit it in one editor. 
 
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>

LOCK and UNLOCK lock and unlock a closed object or door.  You must have
the requisite key to LOCK or UNLOCK.

PICK can open a lock without having the key.  In order to PICK successfully,
you must practice the appropriate skill.

Also see BASH for warriors.
~

0 DRINK~
Syntax: drink <object>
 
Drinking is very important in this game, if you do not perhaps
you might die of dehydration.  Remember always keep you fluids
up!
 
~

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>
 
SACRIFICE offers an object to your God.  God may reward you for the 
sacrifice.  The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
Hint: God likes corpses.
 
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
 
Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE.  All this means is that instead
of fighting, you turn tail and haul ass.  Flee does not always work and you
will lose experience for succeeding or failing for showing such cowardice.
 
~

0 BASH 'BASH DOOR'~
Syntax: bash <direction>
 
A powerful warrior can attempt to bypass the intricacies of unlocking
and opening doors by simply BASHING through them.  This, of course,
tends to make the doors rather useless, which always amuses warriors.
Be aware, however, that bashing is a fairly aggressive action, and
some mobs don't take kindly to that type of behavior...
 
~

0 CHAMELEON 'CHAMELEON POWER'~
Syntax: chameleon
 
With CHAMELEON POWER, a psionicist uses the power of his or her mind to change
the appearance and coloration of his or her body, armor, and equipment to
blend in with the surroundings.  This skill is only effective if the
psionicist remains absolutely still.
 
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>
 
FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.
 
GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.
 
If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.
 
GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
NOTE: You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.
 
~

0 HEIGHTEN 'HEIGHTEN SENSES'~
Syntax: heighten
 
A psionicist is able to heighten there senses some times.  When they do this, 
they have the ability to detect things that would otherwise go unnoticed.  
So in other words, they become more alert, etc.
 
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax: HIDE
Syntax: SNEAK
Syntax: VISIBLE
 
The skill hide, is used by a lot of thieves.  Many times they have to hide
when a storekeeper (or someone else they robbed), is chasing after them
calling for the police.  If done properly most people cannot see you.
 
Sometimes you must also try to sneak out of a room when hiding.  If you
sneak properly, most people will not be able to see you and hear you when
you leave.
 
If you must become visible again, type visible and it cancels you hiding and
sneaking. It also cancels almost any invisibility routine.
 
~

0 'POISON WEAPON'~
Syntax: poison <weapon>
 
With this skill, a thief can create a deadly poison that can be poured
onto any weapon, rendering it more deadly.  This skill is not easy,
however, because the poison itself requires special ingredients, and the
thief must be steady of hand and clear of mind.  The profit-minded thief
(is there any other kind?) might even think about selling the products
of his or her labor to other adventurers for a tidy profit.
 
Caution: The poison is highly corrosive and will damage your weapon
in due time.  Special blades may be more resistant to the poison effects
on the steel.
 
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>
 
PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.
 
PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 
100%, depending on your class.  You must be at a GUILDMASTER to 
practice.
 
The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session. The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
 
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: SAVE
 
SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be at least second level to
save. The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.
 
NOTE: Some objects, such as keys and objects of higher level than you, 
may not be saved.
 
 
QUIT leaves the game. You may QUIT anywhere. When you return to the
game, you will find yourself in the room you last quit in.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command. Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it
 
NOTE: There is no RENT on this MUD.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you 
want to leave.
 
~

0 RECALL 'RECITE RECALL'~
Syntax: RECALL
Syntax: RECITE RECALL

RECALL prays to God for miraculous transportation from where you are back to
your Temple. RECITE RECALL works only when you have a scroll of recall,
and you must have practiced the appropriate skill for scrolls.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain God-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse will not recall at all.
~

0 SPELLS~
Syntax: spells

This command shows the spell caster how much mana each spell he or she knows
will cost.

For a list of ALL available spells for your class, type SLIST.
~

0 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <amount>

SPLIT splits some gold between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the gold after a kill.
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins    <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>
 
Steal is the one skill that defines a person as a thief.  If you are
a thief most of your life revolves around this skill.  Thieves would
much rather take something from someone else, rather than earn it.
But what can you say?  They are thieves.
 
Beware: There are penalties for using steal on other players.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <'str'|'int'|'wis'|'dex'|'con'|'hp'|'mana'|'move'>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial practice sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these practice sessions at a TRAINER (there are several in town).

It costs five practice to train an attribute, except that it costs
only three practice to train your prime attribute.

You may also train your hitpoints, mana points, and movement points.  Each
of these costs one practice session and gives a somewhat unpredictable gain.

The best attributes to train first are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
WIS and CON both to 18 before practising or training anything else.
~

0 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

54 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

54 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, etc.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

53 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~

52 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK NEWLOCK NUMLOCK~
Syntax: reboot
Syntax: shutdown
Syntax: wizlock
Syntax: numlock <number>
Syntax: newlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level immortal without a special bit set may not log in.  Players who
lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NUMLOCK shows at which character level and below may not log in.

NUMLOCK <number> sets which character level and below MAY NOT log in.
Players level immortal and above with a special bit set MAY log in.
Players who lose their links, however, may reconnect.

NEWLOCK is a shortcut to NUMLOCK 1.  NEWLOCK will turn on numlock but
not turn off if currently set.
~

53 DENY DISCONNECT FREEZE~
Syntax: deny       <character>
Syntax: disconnect <character>
Syntax: freeze     <character>

DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.
DENY is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within the
game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal a
DENY by editing the appropriate player file.

DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

-1 WAR WARRIOR~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Warrior        |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION: The warrior class is the most basic fighting class available.
Their battle training along with high strength and high hitpoints make them
very formidable in hand to hand combat.  Warriors train in the art of multiple
attacks.  Some master the art of second attack and if experienced enough,
master third attack.  Along with this training in multiple attacks, a warrior
is trained in making each hit count.  Enhanced damage is available to only the
learned.  Toweard the defense side of the warrior, skills of parry, rescue,
and bash door allow the warrior to ward off attacks, rush to the aid of fellow
comrades, and open doors rather barbarically.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Warriors work well with Humans, elves, ogres, dwarves, 
RACES         | lizardman, demon, halfling, ghoul, minotaur, troll, and 
              | tabaxi.  The other races have much trouble learning the art of
              | war.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
~

-1 CLE CLERIC~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Cleric         |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  The cleric class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarity
toward defense.  A deity gives the cleric spells in the curing, warding,
and protective divinities.  Clerics being of a defensive nature fare poorly
in the art of mortal combat.  They much prefer to be civil servents to 
society or doctors to their comrades in arms.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
RACES         | Dawrves, humans, elves, and elders seem to create the best
              | clerics, while most other races have a harder time with 
              | mastering the art of healing.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
~

-1 MAG MAGE MAGIC MAGIC-USER 'MAGIC USER'~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Mage           |
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  The mage class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily
toward control over the elements.  The universe contains an unmeasured power
the mage taps into to influence the world.  Mage spells are devoted to the 
invoking, hermetic, and combative nature.  Mages fare a little better than
their cleric counterparts in spell-casting combat, though, they would much
rather stand back and roast their enemies with spells than stand melee.
-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE     | Mages work well with any race that does not have a wisdom or
RACES        | intelligence hinderance.
-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------
~

-1 THI THIEF~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Thief          |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  The thief class can be characterized as a warrior who dropped
out of school to persue more "profitable" means of living.  These wirey
persons have physical endurance slightly less than that of a warrior, but are
much more agile.  Whereas a warrior uses well places weapon slashes, a thief
sneaks to disarm his opponent.  Thieves also excel in the art of stealth.
An unwary opponent might not detet a thief until a backstab is attemted.  To
achieve success in this, the skills 'sneak' and 'hide' are learned.  With a
thief's pick lock and poison weapon skills, a thief also makes the perfect
assassin for a political powerhouse.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Humans, elves, halflings, and shadows make excellent thieves.
RACES         | Ogres, trolls, elders have a hard time handling the
              | profession.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
~

-1 PSIONICIST PSI~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Psionicist     |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION: The psionicist is a 'spellcasting' class similar to mages and
clerics but with several important differences.  Where a mage's power comes
from harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a cleric's power
comes from his or her deity, the psionic derives all of his or her power
from him or herself.  The psionic harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural
forces within his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions
that a psionic can practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be
used on others.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Illithid, humans and demons make for excellent psionics,
RACES         | while most other races have a hard time (if even enough
              | intelligence) to master the psionic class.

flame, well, you're wrong.  You just aren't looking close enough.
~

0 'DEATH FIELD'~
Syntax: cast 'death field'

A DEATH FIELD is a life-sapping region of negative energy.  Only psionicists
of evil alignment can use this power without suffering repurcussions.  The
death field moves out from the psionicist and envelops every character in the
room.  Because player characters have souls, they are immune to its deadly
touch, but all mobiles are susceptible to it.  Should the saving throw fail,
the mobile will immediately die.  If the mobile is of a sufficently different
level than the psionicist, they will shrug off the attack and only take minor
damage.
~

0 'DETONATE'  'DISINTEGRATE'~
Syntax: cast 'detonate'     <character>
Syntax: cast 'disintegrate' <character>

With both of these skills, a psionocist uses his or her mind to affect the 
latent energy inside inanimate objects.  If these objects are close enough to 
the intended victim, they can cause great damage.  For this reason, most 
psionocists choose the victim itself as the target, since there's bound to be 
SOMETHING dead on it, sooner or later.  Mid-level psionicists can DETONATE 
objects on their victim, and extremely skilled psionicists can even
DISINTEGRATE their victims, killing them instantly.
~

0 'THOUGHT SHIELD' 'MENTAL BARRIER' 'DISPLACEMENT' 'FLESH ARMOR'
  'INTELLECT FORTRESS' 'INERTIAL BARRIER'~
Syntax: cast 'thought shield'
Syntax: cast 'mental barrier'
Syntax: cast 'displacement'
Syntax: cast 'flesh armor'
Syntax: cast 'intellect fortress'
Syntax: cast 'inertial barrier'

These are protective disciplines which a psionicist can exercise.

THOUGHT SHIELD and MENTAL BARRIER create damage-absorbing shields held in place
by the psionicist's will.

DISPLACEMENT makes the psionicist appear to be displaced from his or her actual
position, thus making him or her more difficult to hit.

With the FLESH ARMOR devotion, a psionicist can harden his or her skin into an 
armor-like substance.

INTELLECT FORTRESS shares the powers of the psionicist's mind with the other 
members in his or her group, extending a shield around all of them.

INERTIAL BARRIER creates a barrier of positive energy that reduces the damage 
infliced by creatures of negative energy.
~

0 'DOMINATION'~
Syntax: cast 'domination' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can DOMINATE the mind of his or her intended 
victim, causing the victim to do exactly as the psionicist says.  As with
CHARM, the actions of dominated characters affect the status of the dominator;
don't whine if you get a KILLER flag.
~

0 'EGO WHIP'~
Syntax: cast 'ego whip' <character>

Because a psionicist understands the inner workings of the mind so well, he or 
she can attempt to EGO WHIP a victim, making them less confident by bringing
up bad childhood memories, embarrassing moments, and failures.  This lack of 
confidence can significantly reduce their battle effectiveness.
~

0 'ENERGY CONTAINMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'energy containment'

By using ENERGY CONTAINMENT, a psionicist can absorb many forms of energy 
without damage.  As the psionicist gains experience, this skill improves.
~

0 'ENHANCE ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast 'enhance armor' <object>

With this devotion, a psionicist can change the molecular makeup of objects, 
making them stronger and more durable.  This has obvious applications to
armor, but if the armor is already magically enchanted, a psionicist cannot
rearrange its molecules.
~

0 'MIND THRUST' 'INFLICT PAIN' 'PSYCHIC CRUSH' 'PSIONIC BLAST' 'ULTRABLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'mind thrust'   <character>
Syntax: cast 'inflict pain'  <character>
Syntax: cast 'psychic crush' <character>
Syntax: cast 'psionic blast' <character>
Syntax: cast 'ultrablast'    <character>

With these skills, a psionicist can telepathically cause damage to the neural 
synapses of his or her victim.  The devotions are listed in increasing order of
damage inflicted.
~

0 'LEND HEALTH'~
Syntax: cast 'lend health' <character>

A psionicist can LEND HEALTH to a companion in need, but only at his or her own
expense.  That's what friends are for, right?
~

0 'PROJECT FORCE'~
Syntax: cast 'project force' <character>

If a psionicist successfully PROJECTS FORCE, the force of his or her mind will 
strike against the victim's body, causing moderate damage.
~

0 'PSYCHIC DRAIN'~
Syntax: cast 'psychic drain' <character>

With this discipline, a psionicist can drain the strength of an opponent.
The skill becomes more effective as the psionicist gains experience.
~

0 'SHARE STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'share strength' <character>

With this skill, a psionicist can augment the strength of a companion.
However, the psionicist's own strength is reduced at the same time.  It is
possible to augment the strength of several others, as long as the psionicist
does not become too weak.

                         **********************
                         ** The Rules of EOS **
                         **********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

-1 PUFF~
No plain fanfold paper could hold that fractal Puff --
He grew so fast no plotting pack could shrink him far enough.
Compiles and simulations grew so quickly tame
And swapped out all their data space when Puff pushed his stack frame.
CHORUS:
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
        Puff the fractal dragon was written in C,
        And frolicked while processes switched in mainframe memory.
Puff, he grew so quickly, while others moved like snails
And mini-Puffs would perch themselves on his gigantic tail.
All the student hackers loved that fractal Puff
But DCS did not like Puff, and finally said, "Enough!"
                (chorus)
Puff used more resources than DCS could spare.
The operator killed Puff's job -- he didn't seem to care.
A gloom fell on the hackers; it seemed to be the end,
But Puff trapped the exception, and grew from naught again!
                (chorus)

51 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The spells command is used to display your character's list of available
skills and spells.  Slist will also show you all skills and spells available
to your character.  Skills and spells are listed showing amount of pts
(points) it costs for each particular one, when you type spells.  
~

0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest),

gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action (except for autolist), typing it again removes
it. 
~

-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.

version
~

105 ARGLIST~
The mobprog arglist changes from type to type.
For most types it is a percentage (1-100), and on others it is keywords
or an ammount.
I.e., for the hit_prcnt_prog, it's a percentage.. namely if the arglist is 30,
then when the mobs hp is at 30% or less of max, then the prog is triggered.
For give_prog, the arglist is all the keywords of the object to trigger that program
when the object is given to the mob.
And for all_greet_prog, arglist is a percentage, 100 will make the prog run
whenever anyone enters the room (excluding invis imms).
~

105 INEWS~
Numerous commands have been added.
Note:  vused
       wrlist
       mpedit
       hedit
       restrict
~

106 RESTRICT~
Syntax: restrict [commandname] [level]
Syntax: restrict [commandname] log [logtype]
 
Commandname is the name of the command you wish to change the level or
logtype of, you can use shortforms of commands giving there aren't any
other commands with those sames letters or you may not get the one you
wish. :)  Logtype is the type of logging you wish a command to have,
type restrict by itself for quick syntax and the logtypes.  Also,
it is possible to type:  restrict all [firstcmd#] [secondcmd#]
for a listing of commands and the levels which they are currently at.
Firstcmd# is the first command you wish to list from, and secondcmd#
is the number of the command you wish to list to.
~

101 WRLIST~
Syntax: wrlist [type(r/o/m/p)] [lvnum] [uvnum]
 
Wrlist lists the vnums and names of the items in those vnums.  You can list
room vnums and their names with r, objects with o, and mobs with m.  When
listing rooms, it also shows you the resets in each room.  Lvnum is the
beginning vnum you wish to list from, and uvnum is the ending vnum.
Note, with m, if the mob has mobprogs, it will list each of the
different types of mobprogs the mob has.  P will list all the mobs with
mobprogs within the range.  It will show the full mobprog: type, arglist,
AND comlist, unlike with m.
 
When checking for progs (p) using wrlist, please only use a maximum vnum
range of about 25 at a time, or the Mud will crash due to spamming.
~

106 VUSED~
Vused simply lists all the blocks of vnums which have been created to date.
The last line it shows tells you just how many free vnums there are. :)

0 CAST CASTING SPELL~
For all spell casting classes, once you reach a certain level, you recieve 
spells which you may practice, and then cast.  There are spells devoted to
protection, attack, healing, and one or two other miscellaneous subject
areas.  To be able to cast a spell, it must be practiced to at least 1% or
higher, otherwise you will eternally lose concentration.  Spell casting costs
vampires blood points, and with all other spell casting classes it costs mana.
How much mana or how many blood points it takes, is mainly dependant on what
kind of spell it is and how many levels you have been able to practice it.  As
you gain levels, spells that you had on previous levels will drop in mana/bp
cost.  To see how much mana/bp your currently practiced spells will
cost to cast, you may type SPELLS.  Typing PRACTICE will list all currently
practiced spells and skills.  Also, to see all the spells and skills that

replacement string [new].
A command alias can be used in any place where a command is valid.
I.E, any time you see your normal prompt.  By typing a command alias, the
game driver will replace what you typed with the string found in [new].
 
[old] is a one-word string of any length (ie, no spaces or punctuation)..
[new] is any string, including spaces and punctuation.

105 PARAMTYPES PTYPES~
All x_progs are triggered by certain actions, and then are passed through
a check to see if the trigger is activated.  There are various types
of parameters based on these checks, which are compared to the information
received by the game driver.
 
Percent Parameters:
  These are the most common kind of checks.  The parameter is a number
between 0 and 100, 0 meaning the trigger will never activate, and 100
meaning the trigger will activated every time it is called.
 
Word Parameters:
  These parameters may be specified in one of two ways: As a word list or
as a phrase.  As a word list, each word of the parameter is check against
each word of the incoming data, and if any of the words match, the trigger
will be activated.  A phrase parameter starts off with the letter 'p' as
the first word, followed by the phrase to be compared.  In a phrase, all
words compared much match (excluding the initial 'p').
 
Slot Parameters:
  These indicate a spell slot.  Spell slots may be found by using the
'slookup' command.  Be careful to use the SLOT and not the SN, as they
are two different numbers, used for different purposes.
 
Hour Parameters:
  This type takes two arguments: The starting hour and the finishing
hour.  These are called every game hour, and if the time is between the
two numbers, the trigger will activate.  Numbers must be in 24 hour format,
and may wrap around midnight.  (ie: '20 8' would activate every hour between
8:00pm and 8:00am, game time, every game night.)
 
Hitpoints Parameters:
  The parameters for this trigger is a number between 0 and 100, indicating
the percentage of hitpoints the mob has from its max hitpoints.  The trigger
is activated when the mobile's hitpoints to max hitpoints percentage fall
below the specified percentage.
 
Itemlist Parameters:
  This is a list of items which may activate the trigger.  Use quotation
marks (' or ") if you wish to use items with more than one keyword.
eg: 'orange dagger' as opposed to orange dagger.  The first example would
need an item with both names to activate the trigger, and the second
example would need an item with either name to activate.
 
Goldpieces Parameters:
  The ammount specified in the single parameter is the minimum ammount
of gold needed to activate the trigger.
~

101 MVARS MVARIABLES~
All mob_progs may use the following variables:
  $i, $n, $r, and modifications of these (like $e for $n)
 
prog name      | param type | useable variables
---------------+------------+------------------
act_prog       | word       | see below
speech_prog    | word       | (none)
rand_prog      | percent    | (none)
fight_prog     | percent    | (none)
death_prog     | percent    | (none)
hitprcnt_prog  | hitpoints  | (none)
entry_prog     | percent    | (none)
greet_prog     | percent    | (none)
all_greet_prog | percent    | (none)
give_prog      | itemlist   | $o
bribe_prog     | goldpieces | (none)
 
Note: rand_prog and entry_prog do *NOT* have a $n variable available.
 
For act_prog, the variables depend on the information received
Any action that involves an object may use $o.
Any action that involves two or more objects may use $o and $p.
Any action that involves a third party may use $t.
These actions do not have to be done by the programmed mobile.
ie: A person types 'give <object> <target>'.  $o becomes <object>, and
$t becomes <target>.  $t may be the same as $i if the mobile itself is
the target of the action.
~

1 PKILL PK~
PK -> Pkill -> Player Killing

Rules for PKILL  (10/14/97)

[1] Multi-killing of a player is illegal.  Multi-killing is defined
   as killing of the same character within 1 min real time by ANY other 
   character, or by killing of the same character within 10 min real time
   by the same killer.
	ex:
	   ILLEGAL->
	     Joe kills Frank.  Joe kills Frank again only 7 min
	     real time later.
	     Joe kills Frank.  Jim kills Franks only 10 sec. real
	     time later.
	   LEGAL->
	      Joe kills Bob.  Joe kills Frank 10 sec. later.
	      Joe kills Bob, Jim, Frank, and JoBoo all within 5 sec of
	      each other.  (Way to go Joe!)

[2] Summoning is legal.  So turn your no-summon on if you don't 
   want to be summoned.

[3] DO NOT start a pkill if a Reboot warning has been given.  This
   constitues making it impossible for a player to retrieve his/her corpse.
   Also, it makes unnecessary work for the Immortals.

[4] PLooting is LEGAL, but so is revenge.

[5] Mass killing of low-level players by higher-level players will not
   be tolerated.  This does not mean, however, that if a high-level player 
   kills a low-level player that the Imms will do anything about it.  We will 
   stay out of it unless more than four people lower than level 15 are killed
   in a row. (We have log files, so you can't hide)

[6] Pkill is an OPTION.  However, if you talk trash or disrespect other
   people, they have the right to request that your pkill option be turned on.

[7] Immortals WILL NOT help ANY pkill situation. (Unless of 
   course a rule is broken)

1 BUILDING~
Eye of the Storm II perfers to have new and UNIQUE zones.  If the zone
is on anothermud please do not submit it here.  When you create an area for
use with EOSII, you give to the admin of the mud and those assigned by them
the right to use it and modify it on a permanent basis, because of the large
effort required by us to help you build the zone.  We retain the right to
use (or not use) any area submitted to us.  Once a zone is submitted and it
is linked into the mud the author of the zone gives up any rights to remove
the zone from the mud.  We will not give your area away without doing
everything in our power to ask your permission first and we kindly ask that
you do the same for us.  
 
If you feel you are qualified to build for us please speak to
Grunt, who is head of building here.
(Previous building experience is highly recommended)
~

1 NEWBIE~
To the absolute beginner:
 
Welcome to The Storm.  The Storm is a multi user Dungeon game or Mud for
short.  If you have gotten this far you have already chosen your race and
class.  Those choices you have made have created the character you are now
controlling.  You can make your character do almost anything by using a command
and pressing enter.  If your screen scrolls while you are typing just continue
to enter your command the mud will understand you.
 
 
Some commands to get you going are as follows:
   >look           and also 'look in <item>'
   >say            followed by the sentence you wish to say
   >who will show all visible players.
   >tell <person> and what you want to tell a person.
   >chat and what you want the world to hear.
   >exits          will reveal all obvious exits from the room you are in
   >north          will take you to the north if you can go there
   >south          -------------------- south -------------------
   >east           -------------------- east  -------------------
   >up             --------------------  up   -------------------
   >down           -------------------- down  -------------------
   >inventory      lists the items you carry
   >equipment      lists the items you are using
   >get <item>     to pick up an item
   >score          gives you your current score.
   >save saves your char and equipment.
   >quit  quits the game.
 
All commands can be abbreviated.  Thus the command 'look' can be abbreviated to
just 'l'.  Names of things and items can NOT be abbreviated, you must write
their full name to refer to them.  Be careful! Learn which abbreviations trigger
which commands.  For instance, 's' is an abbreviation for 'south' not 'say' and
sc is an abbreviation for score.
If you want to know more commands try just typing "help" by its self on a
line and press enter.  Also to find out more about commands try typing the
word "help" followed by the command for example try:
  help look
  help autoexits
For the extreem newbie and even the seasoned mudders we suggest you go through
mud school to learn how all the commands work.  In mud school you can do
everything from make your first few levels to buying a few needed items for
adventuring.
If you get stuck feel free to ask questions on the chat channel or check the
who list for a god with "Mortal Council" in their title.  Please try not to
bother other gods as they are usually very busy trying to add  to the world.
  From all the gods here at Storm we hope you have fun and wish your
  character luck as it runs into anything and everything.

0 RANGER~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Ranger         |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  The ranger class is a class devoted primarily towards hand-to-
hand combat.  The ranger, much like the druid, has a powerful affiliation with
nature and recieves limited spells from the druid class repetoire.  Though
the ranger does not have as many multiple attacks as the warrior, his
spellcasting abilities make the ranger a formidable foe.  Few can best a 
prepared ranger.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Dwarves, elves, humans and lizardmen make for the best
RACES         | rangers, while most other races either find it more difficult
              | or do not care for nature as the ranger does.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
~

0 BARD~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Bard           |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION: Bards are travelling minstels, collecting takes and lore wherever
they happen to be.  They are extremely curious and have a deep wanderlust.
They usually form their stories into songs.  Bards rarely stay in one place
too long.  On their many journeys, bards have become a jack of all trades,
but masters of none.  They possess many skills and spells from the different
classes gathered as they wander the Realms.  Bards posses the gift for words
and singing.  Their voices and songs possess great powers.  They sing their
songs in perparation of battle, during battle, and after to protect, destroy,
and heal.
 
See help 'sing' for more details.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Elves and humans seem to be the only races that possess the
RACES         | charm, singing talent, and the vigor that it takes to be a 
              | bard.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
~

0 DRUID~
-----+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Druid        |
-----+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  Druids are a powerful nature based class.  Their intimate
knowledge of the land allows them to draw magic from it.  They use nature
as their ally, controlling it and shaping it to fit their needs.  Druids are
the priests of nature, and the guardians and protectors of the forests.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Minotaurs, pixies, elders, elves, and humans make for good
RACES         | races, while all others cannot seem to grasp the control
              | of nature needed to become a druid.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
~

0 PALADIN~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Paladin        |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  The paladin is an incredible fighter that lives by his deeds.
As strong as a warrior, the paladin fares well in battle.  His skills are not
only in the art of war, but in the art of healing.  With luck, tales of a 
paladin's deeds will live long after that paladin has ceased to exist. 
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Minotaur, lizardmen, and humans are the only races that are
RACES         | skilled in the ways of a paladin.  All other races do not have
              | the paticular heart, and nature that it takes to live the life
              | of a paladin.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
~

0 VAMPIRE~
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Vampire        |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  The vampire is a class that owns the night.  Their spells are
focused on draining the life from the living.  They get their power from the
blood of others.  Vampires possess the spell 'Dark Blessing' which
greatly improves their hitpoints and damage roll.  Vampires are also powerful
fighters who can dual wield.  A vampire, however strong, has a huge 
disadvantage from the sunlight, and must be indoors to be safe from the suns'
harmful light during the daylight hours.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Shadows, trolls, minotaurs, and demons
RACES         | make the best vampires.  Humans, elves, dwarves, and pixies
              | have a harder time as mastering the skills and spells of a
              | vampires life, but still manage.
--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
~

102 NEWCORPSE~
Syntax: newcorpse <player> Syntax: newcorpse <player> <corpse #>
Newcorpse allows you to recreate a corpse for a player who has lost thiers. 
The player must be online in order for the corpse to be recreated.  The 5
most recent corpses will be saved.  Typing newcorpse <player> will display a
list of corpses and number of items each corpse contains The corpses will be
flagged as valid or invalid.  DO NOT recreate an invalid corpse.  The
newcorpse routine is fairly intelligent and will not save corpses containing
only one item.  Therefore if the player has died trying to get his original
corpse, and has only a light source, that corpse will not be saved.  Once
the apporiate corpses to be recreated is decided upon , typing newcorpse
<player> <corpse #> will recreate the corpse.  The corpse will be recreated
in the room in which you issued the command.  
 
~

1 RACE RACES~
There are 16 races available to choose from on TSR, each with their own
bonuses and penalties.  To see a description, these bonuses, and more, type
help (race name).  The races available are as follows:
 
Human        Elf       Elder       Ogre
Dwarf        Pixie     Lizardman   Demon
Halfling     Drow      Ghoul       Illithid
Minotaur     Troll     Shadow      Tabaxi
 
See also 'race modifications' for a chart of the bonuses and penalties
(attribute wise) for each of the races.
~

1 CLASS CLASSES~
TSR contains 13 classes, each varying in abilities and proficiencies.  The
classes are as follows:
 
Mage       Cleric       Thief       Werewolf
Warrior    Druid        Ranger      Psionicist
Paladin    Bard         Vampire     Necromancer
Monk
 
For more information on a specific class, type help (class name).
~

101 PET_SHOP~
Pet Shops are one of the more tricky aspects of building, because a pet
shop requires 2 rooms in order to function correctly.  The first room is
where the person goes to buy their pet.  The second room is where the mobs
for sale are reset to.  It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that the second room be
the VERY NEXT VNUM after the first.  (Thus if the pet shop is room 1234,
then the second room where the pets are stored should be 1235) 
Room1: Gets the pet_shop flag. No mob is necessary but one just standing there
       pretending to be a shopkeeper adds to the reality. The mob is not a 
       shopkeeper, the room itself is the shopkeeper.
Room2: This is where you reset the mobs for sale. the mobs must have the flag
       'Pet' toggled under the act section. Prices are set by mob level.
 
-Grunt

101 INVOKE~
Ok builders,.... here's the info you all have been waiting for.
 
While in oedit, you have the possibility to do 5 things with INVOKE.
These are set by the ac_type command.  (See help AC_TYPE)  The most 
common of these is ac_type 5, which is for casting spells. Once you set the
ac_type, you then must fill in any other information required.  For casting a
spell, you must provide a spell (help ac_setspell) and a current and maximum
charge level (help ac_v1, and ac_v2).  To change an object from the current
one to another, you must provide a second object the current one will 
transform to (help ac_vnum).  Here's a sample for invoking invis:
 
ac_type 5
ac_setspell invisibility
ac_v1 5
ac_v2 5

which let's them aborb all the remaining life force in a corpse when they
destroy it.  They have named this skill gravebind and it is the best
method to get rid of corpses.
~

1 SPELLCRAFT~
When Mages become more knowledgable in the arts, they are given to the
learning of this skill.  A Mage skilled in spellcraft is able to double the
power of his damage dealing spells.  
~

1 MULTIBURST~
syntax: multiburst <spell> <spell>
With this skill, a mage is able to summon enough energy within himself to
cast two spells at once at his opponent.  Because this process takes
much concentration, the mana cost of using this is much greater than
that of the regular spells totalled up.

CLASS| Necromancer    |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------

--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
~

1 ENHANCED CLAWS~
Werewolves being animals, the adore fighting with their claws.  At an
early period in their lives, the develop a better fighting style with only
the use of their claws.  Enhanced claws is the skill in which a werewolf
learns how to better wound his opponent when fighting bare handed.  (If you
can call razor sharp claws bare hand, that is...)  
~

1 DUAL CLAWS~
When a werewolf becomes more adept at fighting bare hand, he becomes more
skilled and better balanced.  It is at this point that one starts to fight
using both claws at once.  No longer raking and clawing only with one hand,
werewolves become even fiercer adversaries.  
~

1 RAGE~
Rage is the ability of a werewolf too unleash all his anger and revert to
the most primitive form of his species.  When enraged, werewolves lose all
sense of modern warfare, refusing the use of weapons.  They, however, become
a force to be rekonned with with in melee battles, using brute force to
crush their opponents.  
~

1 STENCH OF DECAY~
syntax: c 'stench of decay' <victim>
With this spell, Necromancers invoke the foulest weapon in their arsenal to
inflict damage on their opponents.

~

1 PALM~
This skill allows a master thief to pick up a object lying on the ground or
a object in a container without it being seen by others in the room.
~

1 SCENT~

two rooms deep and in all directions, they can even detect invisible mobiles.
~

1 FRENZY~
While fighting, if you use frenzy, your damroll and hitroll will go up
and your armor class will go down.
~

1 ADRENALINE RUSH~
Adrenaline rush lowers DEX by 2 but it improves the number of attacks per round
that you will deal.
~

Use PERMBAN, TEMPBAN, NEWBAN & ALLOW without arguments to see the syntax
of these commands.
~

1 'ENHANCED CLAWS'~
This skill increases the damage a werewolf's claws do in combat.  The use of
this skill is automatic once practiced, but only works while the werewolf is
using his claws.  It will not give a werewolf any extra damage while the
werewolf is using conventional weapons.
~

1 'HOWL OF FEAR'~
Syntax: howl <target>

Faced with the bellowing howl of rage from a werewolf's towering form, most
enemies will be stricken by a sudden overwhelming feeling of fear and paralysis.
Victims effected by a werewolf's beastly howl are generally disheartened and
therefor inflict less damage with each hit and find themselves too afraid to
press their oppenent making their hits landed fewer.
~

1 'ENHANCED REFLEXES'~
Syntax: enhance
Note  : This spell is the skill equivalent of 'haste' and is not accumulative
        with it.

The art of fluid movement, trained by thieves and natural to werewolves, is
displayed through either of these graceful opponent's specialized reflexes.  By
concentrating on your objective and making yourself feel one with it these
groups of men, women and beasts are able to hone their skills and speed into a
near dance of gracefully dealt death allowing them to land blows faster than the
eye can keep up with.
~

1 'DUAL CLAWS'~
After gaining a certain amount of experience in the art of barehanded fighting
werewolves give up some of their defensive forms to learn the tactics of
attacking with both claws.  For them to be allowed this freedom of movement they
must not use a shield or hold any items, freeing their hands and arms enough to
allow quick movement.  This skill once learned is automatic in function and
works similar to 'dual wield', but does not require a second weapon to be used.
~

1 'RAKE EYES'~
Syntax: rake <target>

Sensing an opening in your defenses a trained werewolf will quickly
press his or her advantage by taking a swift and savage strike at your
eyes, gouging them with their sharp claws.  This attack will almost
always leave an opponent blind and wishing he'd paid closer attention,
but is not accumulative, due to it's damaging nature.
~

1 'DOUBLE BACKSTAB'~
A true master of the thieving arts might learn the skill of striking with not
one, but two backstabs.  Requiring the agility known only to a select few of the
world's adventurers, this ability demands a high mastery in the art of stealth
to slip behind someone and take them by surprise enough to land more than the
first backside blow.  Although while it has many advantages, this does leave a
thief's striking range rather short, since to strike multiple blows he must use
both hands with daggers ready.
~

102 DEMM_102~
~

101 DEMM_101~
The world twist and spirles in.  Power drains away from you leaving you
empty.  A meager spark remains from the power you once had.

101 GRUNT~
Ok, Arch had a good idea in mind when he set a schedule for his usual
times to be around here on the mud, so I've decided to follow along, here is
when you can usually find me either here, or on the builders port.  I'm
usually on both at the same time when I am on, to make it easier for people
to find me.  
 
Monday:    6-11pm EST
Tuesday:   6-11pm EST
Wednesday: 6-11pm EST
Thursday:  6-11pm EST
Friday:    6-11pm EST

-1 'IMMORTALS'~
While mortals are the lifeblood of a MUD, immortals are the guiding force
directing it in the right direction, but how each immortal (imm) acts in
their job varies greatly.  Thalador have been receiving a GREAT
many notes upon subjects they either shouldn't have to or don't have time
to deal with.  Please only note them if the problem -requires- their
direct help or an immortal specifically asks you to do so.  Here's a list
of those to look for in help, wether they're on or not:
                                                          | Note to:
* Pfile errors (check with an imm first to varify)........| Thalador
* Coding bugs of any sort, suspected or fact..............| 1045
* Suggestions for new abilities...........................| 1045
* Errors in areas, items and\or mobs of any sort..........| Grunt & Sherf
* Inquiring of becoming a builder.........................| Grunt & Sherf
* Questions in general of clans...........................| CLANS
* Questions for immortals in general......................| Immortal

CLANS     = the Clan Guild (Anyone related to clan running)
1045      = the Coder Guild (All of the MUD's coders)

If in doubt, look at the help files on immortals help '106', '107', etc..
which will give a more indepth look at their job description.  Then type:
"who 106", check the 'wizlist' and ask the lowest leveled person on you
can see.  This is our 'chain of command', please use and respect it.
Thank you for your time & effort into making this MUD what it is today.
~

106 IMM TOYS~
An Imm Toy is any item created by an Imm with illegal stats on it.
Illegal stats meaning something that would NOT be allowed in game.
Imm Toys cause more crashes and headaches around here, and that leads
to pissing me off, and you really don't want to do that.  Imm Toys are NOT
allowed, and if you've created any, delete them NOW!  There's enough 
Imm crap in game as it is.
~

1 AUTOQUEST~
Autoquesting is for every level and there are certain rules and
commands to know about.   You have to be at a Quest Master mob to use most
the available commands.  

QUEST INFO: This will tell you what you are currently questing for.
QUEST TIME: Displays the amount of time you have left to complete your current
            quest or the amount of time until you can quest again if you just
            quested.
QUEST POINTS: This will tell you the amount of quest points you have so far.
QUEST REQUEST: This allows you to -request- an autoquest. The Quest Master
               will then see if it has a quest to give you.
QUEST COMPLETE: Once you've completed a quest, return to the Quest Master
                who assigned you the quest, and type QUEST COMPLETE.
QUEST LIST: This lists the available items you can buy with your quest points. 
            You must be at a Quest Master to list or buy items also.
QUEST BUY: To buy an item type QUEST BUY <item>.
QUEST AREA: When you are assigned a quest, you may type QUEST AREA to see what
            area your quest is in.

 
Autoquests are random, and chosen suitable to your level. Sometimes you will
get a quest to kill a mob, or a quest to find an object. If you are assigned an
object quest, the object is placed in the room of a suitable mob according to 
your level. You must go get the object and return to the Quest Master and
type QUEST COMPLETE.  He will then take the object from you and reward you with
quest points.
 
If you are assigned a mob quest, you must go find the mob and kill it, then 
return to the Quest Master and type QUEST COMPLETE.  The mob you are to kill
will have a [TARGET] flag and while you are questing you will have a [QUESTING]
flag.  
 
 --- Before you begin questing, make sure you read HELP AUTOQUEST RULES ---
 
The amount of time you are given for a quest is random, and can range anywhere
from 10-30 minutes.  Once you have completed a quest, you must wait 30 minutes 
-REAL- time before you can autoquest again.  If you request a quest and the
Quest Master doesn't have a quest for you, you must wait 10 minutes before
trying to quest again.
 
The points you gain while questing are saved every time you log off, but don't
last forever.  Each ten levels you lose any quest points you might of gained,
for example at level 10 you would be back at 0 quest points.  So quest lots and
spend your quest points! Don't forget to read HELP AUTOQUEST RULES. Anyone
who doesn't abide by the rules will have to deal with the consequences. We want
this to be enjoyable for everyone.

1 IRONFIST~

With this skill, a monk is able to turn his fist to iron, making him hit
more often and harder.
~

1 IRON SKIN~

this spell is active, the monk is harder to hit and absorbs a bit of damage
inflicted to him.
~

0 CHI SHIELD~

This spell surrounds the caster with shield of his own chi.  This shield
is highly impervious to magic and will reduce the chance of magical spells

-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
CLASS| Monk           |
-----+----------------+---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION: Although he/she is not unfamiliar with weapon combat, the monk
believes in "using what you have" to fight with.  In the form of martial arts,

--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE      | Monks do well when matched with the races of:  Tabaxi, and
RACES         | humans.  They also fare with elves and dwarves but no other

-----+----------------++--------------+-----------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  Made from the joining of man and bull, these ancient beings are
often gaurding various treasures throughout TSR.  Because of massive strength
and amazing stamina, these massive beings live for centuries.  However, due
to their massive bulk, they lack much in dexterity.
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANTAGES  | Headbutt (causes minor damage + a 10% chance at stunning
            | opponent).
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------

------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
~

0 HEADBUTT~
Syntax: headbutt

Minotaurs armed naturally with horns atop their head and built with the
strength of the combination of man and bull are able to use their massive
heads to cause heavy damage to an attacker.  As a minotaur gains experience
out in the world through their lifetime they are able to increase the speed
in which they recover from a sprawling headbutt and slam an opponent again.
Naturally due to their chosen profession, those learned in the arts of
melee combat are easier able to recover from performing a headbutt attack
before those of the magical profession.

*NOTE* Headbutt is a race-specific spell.  You must be of the "minotaur" race
or it will not work.

~

0 'SONG OF MISSILES'~

Summoning magic from depths of their souls, these wandering entertainers are
able to spread out magical missiles comprised of the strength of their voice.
~

0 'SONG OF VOICES'~
syntax: sing 'song of voices' <speaker> <message>
Having spent years training their voices in the arts of entertainment, many
bards have learned how to form the illusion of casting their voice from a
different direction.  Using this they can often make people believe that
someone entirely different from the bard said something they didn't actually
say.
~

0 'SONG OF EVIL SIGHT'~
syntax: sing 'song of evil sight'
Often having to travel from village to village entertaining in the local
inns and taverns, bards have learned to spot those of evil nature through
cautious observation, so they don't find themselves working for someone who
won't pay up after the performance.  This learned ability is invaluable to
a bard's pouch of gold.
~

0 'SONG OF ICY TOUCH'~
syntax: sing 'song of icy touch' <victim>
Modifying the tone of their trained voices, bards are sometimes able to not
simply give the sound of ice to their speech, but cause the actual freezing
of their opponent, spreading fear throughout the victim's soul.
~

0 'SONG OF NIGHT VISION'~
syntax: sing 'song of night vision'
After spending years training themselves to listen to the most acute of
sounds for musical perfection, bards have become adept at focusing into
sounds around them in the dark, where they can then use their eyes to focus
in upon the source of sound.
~

0 'SONG OF PROTECTION'~
syntax: sing 'song of protection' <target>
Taping into their arts of entertainment the skilled performer is often able
to strengthen the moral of their own fearing heart or that of their companion
with a simple song, causing the affected person to increase their ability to
keep out of harm's way.
~

0 'SONG OF EARTHQUAKE'~
syntax: sing 'song of earthquake'

skilled bard can bring about terrifying damage by shaking the very ground
around them with their voice.
~

0 'SONG OF SOOTHING'~
syntax: sing 'song of soothing' <target>
Using their voice to entertain and relax a weary fighter, bards can offer
a slight amount of healing towards the soul, helping to speed up the healing
of the players body.  Bards are also able to lighten their own hearts with
their music through these means.
~

0 'SONG OF SLEEPING'~
syntax: sing 'song of sleeping' <victim>
Carrying the motherhood songs for the purpose of luling an infant child into
sleep to the form of an art, bards can turn this skill to combatitive uses by
making their enemies fall to the ground in exhaustion.
~

0 'SONG OF ADRENALINE'~
syntax: sing 'song of adrenaline'
Using their voice as a cataclyst for focusing their thoughts and strength to
the task at hand, many bards can unleash the powers of the body through music
bringing the body's adrenaline to bear at will.
~

0 BLACKBELT~
Spending their time training in the techniques of the martial arts, a skilled
monk is able to eventually achieve the status of a blackbelt.  One of this
skill level is able to attack with both hands instead of just one as the
begining monks do.  (Use of this skill is automatic once practiced, but you
can't be holding any item or wearing any shield or it will be disengaged.)
~

0 DROW FIRE~
syntax: df <victim>
Harnessing the magical powers of the drow race, these creatures of the dark
can engulf their enemies in a terrifying display of flame.  Someone falling
victim to such an attack is often unable to flee the storm for safty and
finds themselves an easier to hit target for their prey.

*NOTE* Drow fire is a race-specific spell.  You must be of the "drow" race
or it will not work.

See Also: DROW, FAERIE FIRE & INCINERATE
~

0 'ANATOMY KNOWLEDGE'~
After spending years training in the martial arts, many monks further enhance
their studies in hand-to-hand combat learning the makeup of the human body.
This teaches them were the weaker places of the body, including the many
"pressure points" of the body, are, allowing them to cause massive amounts of
damage with a single touch.  Use of these pressure points can often lead to a
monk stunning an attacker in a single move or even on rare occassions lead to
an enemy's death.
(Use of 'anatomy knowledge' is automatic once trained.)
~

0 'FLYING KICK'~
syntax: flying  (while in combat)

Highly trained in the martial arts, skilled monks often improve their kicking
abilities, using their incredible speed and agility to lauch themselves into
the air towards an attacker, heightening the impact.  (Flying Kick is very
similar to the common 'kick' skill, just stronger.)

Requirements:
* Kick

See Also: KICK, MONK
~

0 TRIP~
syntax: trip  (While in combat)
Master thieves, pocessing a near perfect fluid grace to their movements, are
often fast enough to duck down low, using one leg to sweep an attacker's
legs out from under him, before their enemy is even aware of their
intenions.  This usually leaves the victim stunned on the ground as the
impact of the fall knocks the wind from him.
(Trip is similar to the warrior skill of 'stun' in it's effect.)

-1 'BLADE PALM'~
Syntax: blade <victim>

Highly trained in the martial arts, monks are capable of causing much damage
by just one move.  Using the palm of their hand, these noble fighters are
able to cause serious damage to an attacker, possibly leaving the enemy
stunned on the ground or on the very rare occassion kill their opponent.

Requirements:
* Anatomy Knowledge
  (For you to be able to stun or kill with this command.)

See Also: MONK, ANATOMY KNOWLEDGE
~

-1 'SNATCH'~
syntax: snatch  <item> <victim>
syntax: snatch  coins  <victim>

Utilizing their enhanced dexterity in combat, the experienced thief can
manage to steal from you even during combat.  This command works exactly
like the 'steal' command and comes with the same penalties as steal does when
you fail.

Requirements:
 * Steal

See Also: STEAL, THIEF, FLAGGED, THEFT LAWS
~

-1 'NERVE'~
syntax: nerve  (While in combat)

Having spent their lives training in the martial arts and learning where the
various pressure points of the body are, highly experienced monks are able to
disarm an opponent in one move, leaving their arms utterly useless for a
short amount of time.  Due to this nerving attack an enemy can't get things,
quaff potions or retrieve their disarmed weapons, shield & held item until
the pain stops.

See Also: MONK, ANATOMY KNOWLEDGE
~

-1 'FLAGGED'~
What is a flag?
When a player fails to steal successfully from another player they gain a
(THIEF) flag before their names and are now open game to be hunted down by
members of the [MERCENARY] guild.  Until their flag is removed, certain mobs
flagged as executioners will autoattack any thief they find.  Generally
you'll find such executioners at town gates and by healing facilities, but
not always.

Removing your flag:
Quite simple.  You can't :).  Only by death from one of the [MERCENARY] Guild
can you lose your flag or by one of the IMPs deciding to pardon you, which is
extremely rare to never.  But that's the risks.

See Also: STEAL, SNATCH, THEFT LAWS, MERCENARY
~

-1 PUSH DRAG~
syntax: push <player> <direction>
syntax: drag <player> <direction>

Push: This is used to move a _standing_ player from a room against their own
will, by pushing them in an available direction.  It also works vs mobs.
When you push the player, they will be moved into that adjoining room, but
you will remain in the current room.

Drag: This you use to move a _resting_ player from a room against their own
will, by dragging them from that room into an adjoining room.  It works vs
mobs as well.  When you drag a victim you AND the victim will be moved to
the adjoining room.

*NOTE* These work in safe rooms as well.
~

-1 'THEFT LAWS'~
These are the laws set forth by the immortals of this MUD pertaining to the
command 'Steal' when used against players.

* You may NOT under any circumstances lend, borrow, sell, trade or give
  equipment that has been stolen to anyone, including your own characters.
  This pertains to ALL equipment, clan or regular.  This includes hiding
  your stolen equipment in a container and auctioning it or donating it for
  others to retrieve or giving it to mobs to kill and take back later with
  another character.

See Also: FLAGGED, THIEF, STEAL, SNATCH
~

2 SOULBIND~
With the aid of this spell, the Necromancer manifests its greatest power...
The power over life and death itself!
When successfully cast, this spell entraps the soul of the victim which
then becomes the Necromancer's slave.  As a side-effect, the victim's
body is consumed and transformed into a gem-like artifact which
the caster uses to manipulate the soul.
~

-1 'HAGGLE'~
Profit-minded as always, thieves learn at an early age to haggle the storm's
shopkeepers into much better prices than what is listed.  Use of the haggle
skill is automatic once trained.

See Also: THIEF
~

-1 'ENHANCED DODGE'~
The experienced thief, highly trained in the arts of stealth, is capable of
increasing his dodging abilities from being a mere form of evading an attack
to a near art form.  Using this enhanced ability they're able to dodge
attacks that even the nimblest of warriors would be unable to evade.  Use of
the skill is automatic once you have practiced it.

Requirements:
* Dodge

See Also: DODGE, PARRY, SHIELD BLOCK
~

-1 'RETREAT'~
Syntax: retreat <direction>

As a member of a profession trained for the skills of thieving, these
would-be thieves often need a quick way of escaping a scene unnoticed.
Applying their arts of stealth, thieves can retreat from a battle without
losing any experience, but in their haste should they retreat into a door
or wall's direction they won't see it before they run right into it,
temporarily stunning them on the ground.

Requirements:
* Item: Smoke Bomb  (Sheridan's Thieving Supplies)

See Also: FLEE
~

-1 'BLIND FIGHTING'~
Due to their prime time of thieving being at night, thieves have learned to
do their handiwork without even needing to see.  Warriors as well have
learned with experience to hunt down their prey by sound when their sight is
impaired.  Blind fighting allows a thief or warrior the ability to use their
melee attacks (Kick, Punch, Circle, Gouge..etc..) even while blinded.
Use of this skill is automatic once trained.

See Also: BLINDNESS, KICK, CIRCLE, GOUGE, PUNCH, THIEF, WARRIOR
~

-1 'ANTIDOTE'~
Experienced in the arts of poisoning, thieves are also masters of making
quick antidotes to their handiwork.  Able to reverse their own deadly
concoctions, they can create a remedy in seconds.

Requirements:
* Item: Empty Flask (Sheridan's Thieving Supplies [Bethaven])

-1 TROLL TRO~
-----+----------------++--------------+-----------------------------------------
RACE | Troll          || RACE BONUSES | con/4  int/-1  wis/-1  dex/-2
-----+----------------++--------------+-----------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  These creatures, with undying stamina, often grow to obtain a 
state of health few other races believed possible.  Hindered by their slow
intellect and mobility, the troll race is certainly one to be admired.
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANTAGES  | Regenerate hitpoints 5x faster than normal.
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE    | Trolls can be paired with the following classes:  Cleric, 
CLASSES     | Warrior, Vampire, and Werewolf.
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
~

-1 SHADOW SHD~
-----+----------------+--------------+------------------------------------------
RACE | Shadow         | RACE BONUSES | dex/2  int/-2
-----+----------------+--------------+------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:  As black in souls as the night, known by the races of TSR only
as shadows, these lurkers of the dark are ever present.  As graceful in
movement as liquid, shadows are only limited by their lack of independant
thought.
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
ADVANTAGES  |  Sidestep (much like dodge), passdoor.
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
SUITABLE    | Shadows make good:  Mages, Thieves, Psionicists, Vampires, and
CLASSES     | Necromacers.
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
~

0 'SHADOWWALK'~
SHADOWWALK
 
Syntax: shadow <mob>
Syntax: shadow 'mob's name'
Syntax: (Ie.  shadow 'white dragon')
 
Thieves and werewolves of high level and experience are able to apply their
skills at the art of stealth into a form of stalking.  Able to simple disappear
into the shadows before your eyes, these shadow walkers can appear in the blink
of an eye.  Some areas, due to their conditions, are unable to support enough
shadows for their arts, such as deserts in the daytime.  Also their ability is
limited within a certain distance of range, due to the tiring strain of
attempting to remain unseen.
~

-1 'SIDESTEP'~
Utilizing the darkness of the shadows about them, people of the 'shadow' race
are able to dodge even the quickest of attacks, moving before an attacker's
eye can even register them.  (Sidestep has a base dodge % of 50 and goes down
1% per level the mob/player is higher than you.  Example: You (level 40
shadow) are attacking a level 55 mob.  % = 50 - (55 - 40) = 35%).

*NOTE* Sidestep is a race-specific spell.  You must be of the "shadow" race
or it will not work.

-1 FORGE~
_____________________________________________________________________________
Syntax:  Forge <obj> <race> <lvl>

_____________________________________|_______________________________________
Long known as being among the finest crafters of equipment, dwarves have
gained a place of some respect among the races of the realms.  Able to craft
equipment for any race or of any type, these stocky people are sought out by
adventurers all across the storm for their expertise.
There are several things you should know about 'forge' before using it
though.  So please remember to read all of the necessary help files so you
don't find yourself wasting your money.

*NOTE* Forge is a race-specific spell.  You must be of the "dwarf" race or it 
       will not work.

-1 'FORGE RACES'~
FORGE RACES
_____________________________________________________________________________
(Information for the Dwarven racial ability of FORGE.)
Due to the general sizes of many races or their physical attributes, the
forging of equipment for specific races has to be specified.  Here's a list
to the grouping of races.
Reminder: (Forge Syntax)
forge <placement> <race> <level of EQ>

Group 1: Human, Elder, Elf & Drow
Group 2: Ogre, Demon, Minotaur & Troll
Group 3: Halfling, Dwarf & Shadow
Group 4: Illithid & Ghoul
Group 5: Pixie
Group 6: Lizardman

*NOTE* The group #'s mean nothing.  You MUST use the name of the race.
       (Example: forge leggings elf 50)

See Also: FORGE, FORGE LIMITS, FORGE COSTS, FORGE EDITOR
_____________________________________________________________________________
~

-1 'FORGE LIMITS'~
_____________________________________________________________________________
(Information for the Dwarven racial ability of FORGE.)
Here are the limits on a what a person can do with forged equipment:
*NOTE* level = level of the _Equipment_, NOT the dwarven forger.
       All values are truncated.  Ie: 7.6 = 7

Damroll      = *NOTE*             Hitroll       = Damroll/2
Mana & HP    = level              Anti-disarm   = level / 2.5
AC           = -(lvl/2+10)        Weight        = level * .15
Saving-Spell = -(level/7)         Saving-Breath = -(level/7)
# of Affects = (level/10) Max: 6  Blood         = Mana / 3

Flags to Dwarven EQ:
Weapon: dwarven
Armor: dwarven & magic

*NOTE* If the equipment is level 101+ it gets the 'indestructable' flag.
*NOTE* Item damroll is based on weather it's a weapon or armor.  'body' armor
       and weapons are (level / 2.5).  All other forms of armor are
       (level / 8).

         SYNTAX: (in Medit)         | Hours : 0-24 is the range, but unless

1 'GOLDEN AURA'~
_____________________________________________________________________________
Syntax: cast 'golden aura' <target>

Masters of self-defense and healing, clerics are able to errect an aura about
themselves reducing damage by 3/4's.  This spell may be used with sanctuary
for an accumulative effect and clerics are able to offer their holy
protection to others around them, but none save a cleric is able to control
the sheer power of this magic.  Mobs & Players affected by golden aura have a
line saying: "<Target> body radiates a crisp golden aura." when you type look
in the same room.
(Golden Aura can't be invoked by any, but those with the ability to cast it.)

See Also: SANCTUARY
_____________________________________________________________________________
~

1 'SHRIEK'~
_____________________________________________________________________________
Syntax: shriek  (While in combat)

Harnessing the pure destructive power of sound, bards are able to shatter
glass in a player's inventory or even in a protected container.  The only
glass generally found on players of any value is that used in the creation of
potions, vials & flasks.
(Aside from causing a base damage amount with each shriek, every potion that
is shattered adds an extra 10 damage, with a maximum limit of 25 potions
destroyed per shriek.)

See Also: BARD
_____________________________________________________________________________
~

1 'SPIT'~
_____________________________________________________________________________
Syntax: spit  (While in combat)

Using their own acidic saliva, lizardmen have become very adept at fighting
while spiting at their opponents.  The saliva causes a fair ammount of damage
and poisons the ennemy.  On occasion, they aim their spit at the facial part
of their ennemies, thus they can hit the eyes or mouth, rendering their
opponent either blind or unable to cast spells.

*NOTE* Spit is a race-specific spell.  You must be of the "lizardman" race or 
it will not work.

See Also: LIZARDMAN
_____________________________________________________________________________
~

-1 'TRANSPORT'~
_____________________________________________________________________________
Syntax: transport <item> <player>

Transport was created as a convience to players so they wouldn't have to use
the auction channel to pass items between themselves when they're far apart
throughout the mud.  There are a couple things to keep in mind here though:

* This command is for your convience, do NOT abuse it in any way.  This means
  sending tons of items to a player that does not want them and loading up
  their eq for either annoyance or PK reasons.  I don't care the reasoning
  behind it, it's not here as a new PK strategy.

* Please ASK a player before transporting them equipment to keep misunder-
  standings from occuring.

Ok, now that that's out of the way, here's how it works:
You type:  transport quill ashin
You see:   You transport magical quill to Ashin.
Sent back: Magical quill appears magically in your hands from Ashin.
_____________________________________________________________________________
~

-1 AFKMES 'AFKMESSAGE'~
_____________________________________________________________________________
Syntax: afkmes <message>  (Your name is autoput before the message.)

This is just a way of customizing the messages others receive when they try
to send you tells while you're AFK (Away From the Keyboard).
_____________________________________________________________________________
You are a Dwarf and have chosen the vocation of a Mage.
Afk Message: Ashin .  <---- Found in the 'score' list.
You have 126/20 hit, 140/100 mana, 100/100 movement, 21 practices.
etc...
_____________________________________________________________________________
Let's keep these clean though, ok?
Example:
You type: afkmes is AFK mixing up a cup of coffee.
Someone tries to tell you something...
Someone sees: Ashin is AFK mixing up a cup of coffee.
_____________________________________________________________________________
~

1 'FORGE COSTS'~
_____________________________________________________________________________
While much of the work in a dwarf's forging is magic coming from the forger,
a good deal of supplies are needed for creation of equipment.  Here's a list
of what forging will cost you:
Base Cost: level * 10000 <GOLD>  (level 30 = 30000, level 105 = 1050000)

Due to the differences in supplies necessary for the varying magical affects
there lies extra costs within the actual making of the equipment:

             Damroll      = 10k       Hitroll       = 10k
             Stat Raises  = 5k        Hp\mana\AC    = 1k
             Blood        = 3k        Anti-disarm   = 3k
             Saving-spell = 10k       Saving-breath = 10k

*NOTE* "Stat Raises" are referring to str, int, wis, dex & con
*NOTE* Every listed price is set to PER affect.  Ie +5 damroll = +50k gold.

1 'MIST FORM'~
_____________________________________________________________________________
Syntax: cast 'mist form'

Ever the rulers of the night, vampires of medium experience are able to call
a cloaking of mist about themselves, blocking them from being seen by nearly
anything.  Moving silently behind their natural screen they're able to slip
by the various creatures of the realm without raising an alarm or approach
a victim to feed upon before anyone is aware.
(Mist Form is similar in action to the Phase Shift spell.)

On the 1 shield only levels, ONLY SANCTUARY may be used.
When using shields on mobs, the HP of the mob must be reduced to take into
account for the shield bonuses. According to how many shields the mob has,
reduce the HP by using the following percentages to multiply the base hp by.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shields:  One        Two        Three        Four        Five        Six     
============================================================================
Percent:  80%        65%          50%         45%         35%        30%     
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So a level 99 mob with 6 shields would have (31000 * 30% = ) 6300 Hps.

110 DEATH2~
When you die, a corpse is made. If you are AT or UNDER LEVEL 20 it is sent
to the Morgue where you can GET ALL CORPSE and SAVE. Then you have to
choose between the Bethaven Portal and the Ravenwood Portal. To choose, type 
ENTER BETHAVEN or ENTER RAVENWOOD.
 
If you are OVER LEVEL 20 when you die, a corpse is made at that very spot
where death hit you. You are sent to the morgue, and from there you have to
seek out and find your corpse once again to get your equipment back.
 
All affected_by spells are cancelled upon death.
Followers and group members are not affected by your death.
Followers will stop following you upon your death (or theirs, hehe)
 
** Corpses decay over time, and so do the object IN the corpses. You have
30 MUD HOURS (15 real minutes) to seek and collect all your corpse items.
Only you or members of your group may collect things FROM your corpse.**
 
REIMBURSEMENTS will NOT be done under normal circumstances.
~

101 OBJ_CHART~
Anti-Race Groupings:
 
These are the required anti-race groupings based on the size of the equipment.
You may add other anti-race flags, for other reasons, but these must be used
in the cases of armor at the very least.
Group 1     Group 2     Group 3     Group 4          
(small)     (Medium)   (Humanoid)   (Giant)            
-----------------------------------------------        
Pixie    '   Illithid  ' Human      'Ogre     '      
Halfling '   Elf       ' Ghoul      'Demon    '       
Dwarf    '   Drow      ' Elder      'Minotaur '
Shadow   '   Tabaxi    ' Lizardman  'Troll    '
         '             '            '         '
----------------------------------------------
 
Anti-Class Flags:
 
Each class has its own restrictions, as to what they can not use, based more
or less on standard RPG rules. As in the case of anti-race flags, you can add
more, but these are the ones which must apply. These take effect after level
20.
 
 
Class          Restrictions
Mage          'Daggers, Blunt weapons only  Leather or worse armor
Ranger        'Same as Warrior
Monk          'No weapons. Leather or worse armor. No wands/staves
Paladin       'Same as Warrior
Warrior       'No wands, staves. May use any weapon or armor
Thief         'Chain armor or worse, pierce weapons only. No wands/staves
Cleric        'Blunt weapons only, leather or worse armor
Necromancer   'Same as Mage
Psionicist    'Same as Mage
Bard          'No restrictions on weapons, chain or worse armor
Druid         'Same as Mage
Werewolf      'No Silver items, no wands/staves, chain or worse armor
Vampire       'Leather or worse armor, no blunt weapons
 
 
                         Addaffects
Addaffect          Limits          
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hp                 Level of Object
Mana               Level of Object
Move               Level of Object
Blood              Level of Object divided by 3
AC                 Level of Object
Hitroll            Level of Object x 2  (Weapons Only!)
Damroll            Level of Object x 2  (Weapons Only!)
Save vs spell      Level of Object divided by 20
Save vs breath     Level of Object divided by 20
Anti-disarm        Level of Object divided by 10 (Weapons and Hands only!)
 
 
The Hitroll and Damroll bonuses on weapons, being covered by a percentage are
as follows:
Weapon Type   Hitroll  Damroll    Damage Type
-------------------------------------------------------
Dagger          75%      50%      stab, pierce
Shortsword      80%      70%      pierce, slash
Longsword       80%     100%      slash, slice
Greatsword      85%     100%      slash, chop
Axe             80%      90%      chop
Blunt           70%      90%      hit, pound, crush
Whip           100%      30%      whip
Claws           40%      60%      claw, slash
Exotic         var%     var%      suction, blast 
-------------------------------------------------------
 
So a level 60 dagger could have (60 x 2 x 75% = ) 80 points for hitroll and
(60 x 2 x 50% = ) 60 points for damroll. Similarly, a level 20 mace could have
(20 x 2 x 70% = ) 28 points for hitroll and (20 x 2 x 90% = ) 36 points for
damroll.
Exotic weapons use a varying percent based on the kind of magical weapon it
is. In order to keep them in line, the variable percent has 150 points which
can be split into the two percentages, no more than 100% on one.
Remember: ONLY WEAPONS get a hitroll and damroll bonus added to them. And
only weapons and items worn on hands are allowed to have an anti-disarm
bonus to them.
 
 
Max Addaffects:
 
Level    # of addaffects MAXIMUM
--------------------------------
01-20         One
21-40         Two
41-60         Three
61-80         Four
81-100        Five
101+          Six
Stat Raises are governed by level of object only and are as follows:
The number of points can be divided into the number of stat raises.
so 3 points in 2 stats can be +2,+1 or +3. (Note: +3 is the max on any
one stat, for levels where 4 or more points are used)
 
 
Levels   # stats  # points (total)     
----------------------------------
1-10        1         1
11-20       1         1

The spells are distributed by level for these types of potions and are as

Syntax: cast 'bark skin'
 
This spell improves the casters armor class.  As the caster raises in
level so does the protection of the spell.
~

0 AID~
Syntax: cast aid <character>
 
This spell is a more powerfull form of BLESS.
~

0 BLUR~
Syntax: cast blur
 
This magic spell blurs the outline of the caster making it harder for
attackers to hit them with weapons and spells.
~

0 FIREWALL~
Syntax: cast firewall
 
The spell firewall is a devastaing attack that sweaps out in a ring from
the caster.  Attacking everything in its path.
~

0 'DRAW STRENGTH' DRAW STRENGTH~

their max mana for a time.
~

0 FLURY~
Syntax: flury <target>
 
The warrior will throw a flury of punches and kicks going on pure instinct.
~

0 ALIGNMENT ALIGN~
ALIGNMENT is that state in which your character is GOOD, NEUTRAL, or EVIL in
behavior and beliefs.
 
There are many "spectrums" of Alignment, but the above three are the main
states.
 
Alignment is mostly there for roleplaying purposes, in that you act out your
Alignment. Some mobs react differently to certain Alignments, and some
equipment may or may not be usable by certain alignments.
 
~

0 FIREBALL~
Syntax: cast 'fireball' <victim>
 
Fireball is another distinctive spell, that is almost always
associated with mages.  This spell is a favourite among most
mages, because of it's large offensive power.  Truly, it is much
more fun to turn your enemies into a pile of charred steak, then
to do some minor damage on them.
~

0 'ACID BLAST'~
Syntax: cast 'acid blast' <victim>
 
Acid Blast is another nasty mage spell.  When a mage is in combat, sometimes
they use this spell to severely hurt their enemy.  When casted, streaks of very 
potent acid come shooting out of the casters fingers.  If this acid hits the 
skin, it will eat away at it, and leave some very large and unpleasant gaping 
wounds.

you can try to rescue them.  This means that you will take the monsters
attention away from the person who is in trouble.  The monster will then
try and beat on you.

1 EQ_RESTRICTIONS~
____________________________________________________________________________
There are factors that prevent certain races and/or classes from using a
particular piece of equipment. These factors are as follows;
 
RACE: The race of your character may affect what he or she can or
      cannot use.
For Example: A minotaur will not be able to wear most helmets due to its
             great head-size and horns.

SIZE: The size or race of your character depends greatly on which
      equipment you can or cannot use.
For Example: A pixie will not be able to wear the same breastplate that
             a minotaur can and vice-versa.
 
CLASS: Your class(es) may affect what equipment you can or cannot use.
       Multi-classed characters may have a difficult time finding equipment.
For Example: Certain beliefs may not allow that class to use a particular
             type of weapon or armor. Vampires can use only cutting weapons,
             as their goal is to draw blood.
 
Note: Materials of equipment also affects some classes. Currently, the
      Werewolf is prevented from using anything made of silver.

Due to the overwhelming amount of time it takes for mages to study in
preparation for their spellcasting stage, they do not have the time to
practice with hand-to-hand combat. Even those classes with mage as their
second must devote much time and concentration on the language of magic.
This explains why the mage class(es) do not have time to learn how to use
heavier and more complicated means of weaponry.
The mage class is restricted to using small cutting weapons, daggers,
knives and blunt weaponry. Almost any staff or wand can be used by a mage.
Armor worn by the mage is greatly considered when spellcasting. Wearing
a suit of platemail and casting a lightning bolt spell is not an intelligent
thing to do. For this reason, mages have armor restrictions due to spellcasting.
A mage cannot wear any heavy metallic armor, such as platemail, chainmail,
and studded leathers and other heavily metallic accessories. He/she is
restricted to leather armor or worse (unless magically enchanted for that
class).

1 CLERIC_RESTRICTIONS CLE_RESTRICTIONS~
____________________________________________________________________________
A cleric (whether good or evil) goes by his or her beliefs before any
other factor in life. It is up to you, as the player behind your character
to decide and follow what those beliefs will be. As a general rule, clerics
use only the weapons allowed by their Deity. In most common cases, this
involves using a blunt weapon.
Clerics are restricted to using blunt weapons only except where their
Deity permits otherwise. Roleplaying a good aligned cleric will find you
in sticky spots for finding weaponry, as there are not many slashing weapons
available for those that are good at heart. Most every cleric is fluent with
staves and most wands (except for those which are magically enchanted against
him/her).
Armor by most clerics is what their Deity provides for them... a good prayer
and a strong will. The motto "take only what you need" is popular with most
clergy and is usually lived up to. This again, depends on the clerics Deity
and what is permitted.
Clerics are restricted to using only chainmail or worse armor (unless a
specific armor is magically enchanted for their usage).
____________________________________________________________________________
 
Note: Most clerical weapons will be alignment-dependant, although some
      exceptions are made at the builders discretion and by the
      acceptance of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 THIEF_RESTRICTIONS THI_RESTRICTIONS~
______________________________________________________________________________
Thieves are skilled in balance and dexterity, however using a two-handed sword
to maneuver into backstab position is quite impossible even for the best in
that field. Big and flashy weapons also get in the way when hiding in shadows
is necessary. A club or staff is difficult to conceal within the folds of
your armor and clothing!
Thieves are restricted to using small weapons that are easily hidden away
from wandering eyes. Some thieves, however are better at concealing larger
weaponry, so a thief may use any type of piercing weapon. Wands and staves
are not usable by thieves.
Bulky clothing is a no-no for thieves, unless it is made of a very flexible
material. Flexibility is a must for agility and therefore a suit of platemail
armor would not assist you in moving silently. Hiding in the shadows is also
necessary for most thieves and a flashy suit of metal will most likely catch
any glimpse of light and create a reflection which will then give away your
position.
Chainmail or worse is a thieves common armoury, protecting him from that shot
or swing that manages to hit home. Quick movements and dodging are not easy
when you are armoured to the hilt. Bright and flashy equipment is also not
favoured by thieves as it is likely to make them stand out, contrary to their
goal.
_______________________________________________________________________________
 
Note: Some exceptions are made because of magically enchanted weapons and
      armor, but this is at the builders discretion and by the acceptance
      of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 WARRIOR_RESTRICTIONS WAR_RESTRICTIONS~
_______________________________________________________________________________
Because of their heavy training and knowledge about each specific type of
weapon and its usage, warriors are able to use most all types of battlements
proficiently. Though many warriors may learn the theory behind their fighting
tactics, they prefer to learn from the practical side.
Warriors may use any type of weapon, large or small. They are restricted from
using any type of magical wand or staff, however.
In training, a warrior is taught how to use almost anything as armoury. This
in turn gives them no armor restrictions of any types.
Warriors are permitted to use any type of armor (unless magically enchanted
specifically against his/her class).
_______________________________________________________________________________
 
Note: Some exceptions may apply at the discretion of the builder and by
      the acceptance of the CREATION GUILDMASTER.

1 HRULES 'HERO RULES'~
Hero Rules
-------------------------------------------------------------------

        Time to clear some shit up. What can HERO's do and not do?
        Why do we have heros?  Well this will fix that all up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1.) Hero's can NOT PK!!! 

	- If you attack a hero, and are killed its not breaking the rules.

        - However if a hero outright attacks you and kills you 
          please note to immortal with your complaint. But remember
          this, if we go to the time to investigate this, esp since
          the mud is going down, I'll be nuking someone and if your
          wrong then you will be nuked. If the hero is wrong then
          the hero will be nuked. End of discussion.

2.) So what are hero's supposed to do?

	Heros are there to help people out. To RP and keep 
        people with dumb names off the mud. They are basically
        over-seers when the imms aren't around. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
These rules are subject to change with or without notice, at the
descretion of the administration.

100 HEIRARCHY~
Here on TSR, we have gone to the trouble to set up and Immortal
Heirarchy that we expect you to follow and respect.  This system is 
to insure that our Immortal team and system run smoothly.  The ranking
starts with the four administrators and flows downward from there.  
However, if you happen to be having a problem with a particular immortal
higher than you, please feel free to come to one of the administrators
(preferably the Immortal Overlord) and we will here you out and determine
if you are filing a legetimate complaint or just whining.  Remember, the 
good of the mud comes first, and foremost.  

~

100 IMM_LEVELING~
To obtain a higher level as an immortal, you must follow the system
preset by the administration.  Upon completion of a step in that system, 
the admins will then vote upon your performance and make our recomendations
to the Immortal Overlord (who in turn has final say).  Please do not whine
or beg for levels, because that will only result in a less than pleasant
recomendation during the voting process.

0 GUILD RULES~
********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************
                          Guild Rules for TSR 
********************************************************************************
********************************************************************************

  {1}  In order to have an officially recognized guild, you must
     first submit a background story to the immortals for approval.  Upon
     approval we will recognize you as an organized guild; and until then,
     you're just putting something funny looking in your title.

  {2}  No one under level twenty (20) should be in a guild.  This
     being because it takes at least until level twenty to get accustomed
     to the world of TSR, and how it works.  This also gives you time to
     build up an idea of which guild is right for you.

  {3}  All guilds should be HEAVILY involved in role-playing.
     failure to do so will result in first a warning, and then a removal
     from the recognized list of guilds.

  {4}  No Immortals will be allowed to be in any guild.  This
     would totaly defeat the purpose of picking an Immortal to worship upon
     creation, as well as the idea of a completly mortal-run guild.

  {Suggestion}  As a suggestion, it might be good for each member of
     a guild to write up a short ten line background story to their own
     personal character.  This would enhance the role-playing in your guilds
     tremendously, as well as just give you general information about who
     it is that's wanting to join your guild.

***As always, these rules are subject to change and interpretation by the
Immortal staff of The Shadow Realms without any prior notice.

0 'SHADOW FORM'~
A psionicist can use his or her mind power to blend in with the shadows while
moving, having the same effect as the thief skill SNEAK.  See also VISIBLE.
~

-1 LAWFUL_GOOD~
Characters of this alignment believe that an orderly, strong, organized
government and a strong society can work to make life better for all people.
To ensure the quality of life, laws must be created.  Therefore, people of
this alignment strive for those things that will bring the greatest benifit
to the most people and cause the least harm.
~

-1 LAWFUL_NEUTRAL~
Orders and organizations are paramount for people of this type.  Whether the
order come from tryranny or benevolence, it doesnt matter.  The benifits
of organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by
their actions.
~

-1 LAWFUL_EVIL~
These people believe in using society and laws as a benifit to themselves.
Lawful evil characters obey orders out of fear of punishment.  Because they
may may be forced to honor an unfavorable contract or oath they have made,
lawful evil characters are very weary of giving their word.  Once given,
they break their word only within the legal system.
~

-1 NEUTRAL_GOOD~
These characters believe that a balance of forces is important, but that the
laws of chaos and order do not moderate the need for good.  Since the 
universe is vast and contains many different creatures and many different
goals, a determined persuit for good will not matter.  If supporting good
means that you must uphold law, then so be it.  If supporting good means
overthrowing society, then so be it.
~

-1 TRUE_NEUTRAL~
These characters believe in the ultimate forces of balance and they refuse to
see actions as good or evil.  Since the majority of the people in the world
make judgements, these characters are few and far between.  True neutrals
do their best to avoid siding with the forces of good or evil, law or chaos.
It is their duty to make sure that all forces are kept within balance.
~

-1 NEUTRAL_EVIL~
Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves and are
interested in their own advancement.  They have no paticular objection to
working with others, although they like to go at it alone, if possible.
If there is a quick and easy way to their goal, they'll take it.  Although
NE characters do not have the chaotic attitude of "every man for himself",
the character will have no problem with betraying friends to reach their
own ends.
~

-1 CHAOTIC_GOOD~
CG characters are strong individualists marked with a steak of kindness.
They believe in goodness and right, but have little use for laws and
regulations.  They are guided by their own morals, and they strive for 
goodness, although they may not agree with societys values.
~

-1 CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL~
CN characters believe that there is no order to anything.. not even their
own actions.  They do whatever it is that strikes them at the time.  CG
characters are extremely hard to deal with, and are very unreliable.
In fact, the only thing that you can rely on is that they cant be relied
on.
~

-1 CHAOTIC_EVIL~
These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized.  They are
only out for their own ends whether it be right or wrong.  They absolutely
see nothing wrong with taking whatever they want whenever they want it.
The strong have a right to take what they want, and the weak are to be
exploited, according to these characters.
~

-1 FAST HEALING~
Fast healing is a skill that is automatic with the ticks of the mud.  At
every tick, the mud will check to see if you aquired 'fast healing' for that
tick, and apply.  What it does, basically, is allow you to heal up faster.
~

-1 MEDITATE~
Meditate, much like fast healing, is a skill that you do not have to 
physically type in for it to work.  Meditate is checked every tick of the mud.
If you got the meditate skill for that tick, then you regenerated mana quicker
than normal that tick.
~

-1 GOD_BEOWOLF~
Beowolf, the Lord of War & Chaos, is the ruthless and tactful Warlord for the
Army of Chaos under Dymeir.  His motives and actions serve those of chaotic
evil in alignment.
~

-1 GOD_AKASHA~
Akasha, the ShadowQueen, is the Mother of all those of shadowy existance.
Her mysterious nature and intelligence make for a wicked combination in an
Immortal.
~

-1 GOD_VARIANT~
Variant, the Hand of Justice, is the ruling judge of Retribution.  Sworn to
protect the people of the Shaikari, Variants job is never done.  His kindness
and strong personality lead those who wish the best for the Realms.
~

-1 GOD_LARIC~
Laric, the Lord of Flux, is rumored to be mad.  But there is a superior
intelligence found behind his babble that renders him with unopposing
power.  He truly acts upon whatever strikes him at the time, and those who
follow him are much the same.
~

-1 GOD_ANNIBUS~
Annibus, the Beast of Rage, takes the form of a dragon in his real state.
He represents evil, and with the help of those who worship him, he spreads
tormet and destruction across the Realms.
~

-1 GOD_TERRAM~
Terram, the Elemental of Nature, is the guiding hand behind all that happens
within the Realm of Nature.  He is not only kind at heart, but neutral in
many aspects as well, as nature is.  Those who follow Terram have a natural
love for nature and its ways.
~

-1 GOD_MIROJ~
Miroj, the God of Contemplation, the sage and all knowing form of the
Realms. Those who may use their minds in life will want to consider Miroj as
a diety. He searches for the use of knowledge and wisdom as power, and
believes that no one man is more rightous than another. True Neutrality is
the key to the world of Contemplation. 
~

-1 GOD_BRYELLE~
Bryelle, the Goddess of Insurrection, is a kind and strong leader with a 
divine passion for the people of the Realms.  She takes what she believes
to heart and acts upon what she feels.  Her followers, do much the same.
~

-1 GOD_RHYLUS~
Rhylus, the God of Providence, is a kind and innocent dwarf.  He came to these
Realms intending to help ease the pain on the mortals.  His paticular insight
is invalueable, as is his humor.
~

-1 GOD_KRAST~
Krast, the Lord of Order, keeps the Realms straight and tight. His wisdom
is sought, as is his paticular brand of value in many situations. 
His neutrality and order are what make him an essential part to these Realms.
~

-1 GOD_NONE~
If you choose this, you remain neutral to all Gods.. and sacrifice the

-1 GUILD_STRIFE~
Strife.  The acceptance of the Truth and the Knowledge to spread it.  It is
the intention of Strife to create, hold, and spread, an everlong Balance
within the Realms.
 
Too many times have the mortals and Immortals of this era, and eras past,
spoken of "absolute truth", and "greater times ahead."  Seeing the true
meaning of these words, and what they create is what Strife intends to end.
 
Those that speak these lies intend to create hope.  Something that the weak
and timid can hold on to.  Something that allows the sick to further tighten
its grip on Oblivion.
 
We aim to end these lies.  To end the destruction, false tales, and 
hopelessness that disease everyday life.  Some may say that it is the intention
of Strife to conjure evil within the Realms.  Some say the opposite. 
We do neither.  We accept all that are willing to spread the Balance and light
of the Absolute Truth and the Wisdom that comes with it.
 
A wise man once spoke of Strife and said this:  "The time draws nigh.  Soon 
all the world will know the terror that we bring.  If they cannot accept the 
Truth of our existance, then they shall be destroyed by it."

0 GUILD_ERUDITION~
Erudition means Knowledge.  To have knowledge is to be graced by a power 
greater than a sword.  For knowledge has a keener blade, and can cut down more
swiftly.  Erudition is based upon knowledge, and what it takes to learn.
Erudition is here for the betterment of our minds, for our bodys will follow.
Erudition is sekkers.  Whether they seek to know death, life, greed, 
poverty, it is all within our grasp.  Erudition follows only one thing.  If
there is a law that helps the betterment of knowledge then it shall be abided
by, if it is one that slows the growth of knowledge it shall be struck down.
 
Might is not the question here, it is the light has graced your being.  The
test is easily said, the following through difficult.  The test is placed upon
your mind, and soul.  Combine and you pass, fail and you well, you are exposed
to a truth that can sear a mortals soul.
 
"Mortals must learn to work together and spread the knowledge that they hold
within their minds.  However, they seek glory.  With Erudition one thing is
true.  Through our Knowledge we know more glory than any hero who has graced
these plains."

0 CLOSING~
TSR WILL BE CLOSING ITS DOORS SOON!!!

Sometime around July TSR will be closing III down forever. 
Thank GOD!! This codebase has been determined to be the
buggest codebase the immortals have ever worked on. 

They will show great joy once this code goes. If you
would like to get a copy of the code you can find it at
ftp://ftp.game.org/pub/mud/diku/merc/envy/eos/storm_code.zip

The main reasons for III's departure are stated below:

1.) The code lags hard! When someone types in certain
    commands it causes the MUD to cycle through endless
    useless information and causes the MUD to LAG!!!
    The memory and CPU management for this codebase SUCKS!

2.) The MUD is WAYYYYY overbalanced. We are striving for a
    RP environment where things are balanced and you fit
    into the flow of the world. Having an unbalanced MUD
    sucks.

Please do not bitch or whine to the immortals. Their involvement
with this code will be VERY little. We are busy working on
TSR IV right now. If you don't like it too bad. Go play
a different MUD. We have a vision in which we are trying
to create.  Hence our advertising our sister MUD for those
who will not want to play the new version.

Also RP will NOT carry over to IV. So basically this mud is
a waste of time. All players will be wiped out before the
new mud opens.  This code sucks I can't wait to take it
down.

113 DS~
This command has replaced the desc_check and the desc_clean
commands that used to be in the game. 

Syntax: ds check
Syntax: ds clean

When used with the check option it will display a list of
all the current descriptors open in the game. It will show
the desc number and then if it is open or not. When used
with the clean option it will go through and "close" out
old descriptors that might still be hanging around.
