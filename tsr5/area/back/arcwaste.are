Ice Devil~
An Ice Devil~
An ice devil flies above you mocking your bad fortune.
~
The Ice Devil is Satan's cold variety of the common demon. The Lord of  
Darkness has created this species to extend his rule into the arctic areas
of Storm where other demons way perish due to the lack of fire.
The Ice Devil is not really aggressive, but his constant mocking is really
getting to you...

Clan Skill\Spell Guidelines:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This I pretty much leave to you, hoping you'll find something creative that
supports your clan theme, but I feel there need be a couple pointers on what
type of skill\spell not to choose:

1..> I'd like not to see skills that are built off of a spell\skill that is the
     basis for damage of a particular class.  Skills like backstab for thieves
     or multiburst\spellcraft for mages.  To give these to all your clan members
     hurts the class the ability comes from in fights.  Makes them less useful
     in groups as well.  Think of it this way..don't use the best to skills of
     any one class.  Like a mage's spellcraft & multiburst, or a cleric's
     dispel magic & dancing lights, a warrior's enhanced damage two and berserk.
2..> I'd also like not to see skills that help only one or two classes UNLESS
     your clan is based around that one or two classes.  Like a skill that in
     truth only helped thieves, I'd rather not see unless your clan is one of
     purely thieves.

These are all I'm going to limit on them and that only so we don't get skills
that either take away power from a particular class or only help one class of
your clan.  Aside from those..think up original stuff and check with me, Lacey,
and Thalador.

Clan Raids:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rules regarding Deities defending their HQ:
  1.> Deities may ONLY attack those mortals within their HQ, not those just
      outside.
  2.> Deities cannot do anything a mortal cannot.  This means that the use of
      immortal commands (force, goto..etc..) is ILLEGAL.
  3.> You're free to use only spells or equipment accessible to mortals.  Please
      do NOT use items from a proto area that isn't still stuck on 2222.  Also
      use only your own clan skill incase any of you Deities get 'mset'.
  4.> The use of area attack spells such as 'psychic quake', 'gas breath' or
      'ultrablast' are probited due to their damage being based in hp and your
      ability to have 30k hp.  You'd simply kill them in one shot w/multiburst.

Guidelines for Non-Guardian Clan Mobs:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Mobs: Healer, Blacksmith, Banker, Vampire Feed Mob, Baker, Secretaries,
               EQ dispensers, Potion Sellers, Trade-In Mob, General Store &
               other misc. mobs.
Many of the types listed above can be joined btw.  You don't have to have a
seperate store for clan potions and containers or a seperate mob for doing the
trade-in process or the EQ dispensing process.  Those are listed just incase you
wish to spread them out.  Guidelines for most mobs should be the same.
  Level = 100
  HP & Shields = Set by Grunt's Mob Creation Book
The only exception to this is the Vampire Feed Mobs.  I'd like those to have an
HP amount of 300,000 and be level 1.  Also add a mobprog to them like this:
Mobprog Type  = speech_prog
Prog Argument = "quit" (Whatever you wish really, but have it in the room desc.)
Prog Commands =
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if isclan($n) == <Your clan number, check 'clans'>
  emote shoves you away roughly screaming to be left alone.
  mptransfer $n <A room bordering the mob>
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also please add this prog to Vampire Feed mobs as well:
Mobprog type  = rand_prog
Prog Argument = 50
Prog Commands = c 'complete heal' self

These are for your member's convience.  The rest I leave to you.

Trade-in Mob setup:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the sake of example I'll use the following assumptions on the item...
name (keywords)  = silver dragon helm elysium
item vnum        = 2159
clan's ID #      = 2
mobprog type     = give_prog
mobprog argument = silver dragon helm elysium
mobprog commands =
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
emote studies the object a moment.
if isclan($n) == 2
  say Let me see what I can do.
  emote fiddles with the item for a bit.
  mpjunk helm
  mpoload 2159
  give helm $n
  say That should fix it.
else
  say Why thank you for returning this object that is obviously not yours.
  mpjunk helm
  say Now, do yourself a favor and get the hell out of this clan's home.
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feel free to add in\change emotes and says as you wish, those in are purely for
example.  With this form of program the only times a member will need to be
given a new "champ" item will be when they're first inducted, die and lose their
corpse or are PK'd and plooted.  But this is only for the "champion lv100" item
and the "lv65/75" item.

Clan Guardian Mob Guidelines:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GATEGUARDS:
-----------
Instead of 3 gatekeepers, we've decided to leave it at 1 gatekeeper.  Basically
I'm looking for a cross between the Dragon King w/dispel magic and a champion on
a major PCP high.  He can't use 'shatter' or 'molecular unbinding' though, nor 
is he allowed to load himself as a death_prog.  Here's what I'd like to see:
level   = 106 (This'll keep death field off your guard)
HP      = 30,000hp
Shields = As many as you can pile on w/o using progs to add 'blade barrier' or
          'field of decay'.
Other than that, have a blast..you're limited to 1 and I want him hard as can
be, but still passable for a couple champs.  With 3 before we'd likely have
almost no one raiding..it just wouldn't be worth it.

Equipment for GATEKEEPER guardians:
Guardians may wear any of your clan equipment and in addition may dual wield a 
lv100 -piercing- weapon that you create.  The flags for the weapon are set as 
this:
level       = 100
Extra       = no_damage, nolocate, inventory, poisoned, chaotic & flame.
take        = take & wield
addaffects  = hitroll +20 & damroll +20
attack type = piercing

WANDERING CLAN GUARDIANS:
-------------------------
Wandering clan guardians are built in the exact same way, except for the
following changes:
You may have 1 wandering guardian per 10 rooms in your HQ that are USED.  Not
empty.  1 per 10 rooms rounded up.
level = (Peaceful 104) -<PK 100>-
act = stay_area

Any questions regarding something I've left out here feel free to leave me a
note on or ask me if I'm around.

Clan HQ Exits:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From now on I want 3 exits in every clan HQ.  What exits depends on what
alignment you claim your clan is.  Neutral aligned clans shall consider
themselves as good aligned clans in this list.
 _______________________________________________________________
 |Town\Place             |Vnum    |Alignment  |Referrence Point|
 |-----------------------|--------|-----------|----------------|
 |Bethaven               |  25001 |All aligns |Jezabel         |
 |Ravenwood              |   1301 |Evil clans |Liakhara        |
 |Ravenwood - outside    |   5300 |Good clans |none            |
 |Hammerheim             |  10211 |All aligns |Rodgaar         |
 |_______________________|________|___________|________________|

I want evil clans exiting to Bethaven as well simply because of the numerous
things built around that town.  Bethaven is the mud's heart in truth for now so
it shouldn't be cut off from those of evil alignment.  Your clan members should
be allowed easy access to the donation rooms, class noteboard, etc...  That and
Bethaven itself isn't really a "good" aligned city, with thugs and vagabonds
roaming it's streets freely.

giant strength, heal, web, pass door, haste, detect hidden, detect invis, invis,
mass invis, astral walk, fly, locate object & refresh)
Also it is 15/15 invokes as the limit.

General Guidelines on Clan EQ:  (not potions, pills & scrolls)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1..> Clan EQ can't be a weapon or body armor.
2..> Clan EQ can't be an item that can be worn twice upon a character. (ie neck,
     finger, wrist, orbit & ankle)
3..> Clan EQ should be cost: 0...it's not supposed to be sold.
4..> If you're an evil clan, it's in your own best interests to make clan eq
     anti-good..and vice versa for a good clan.  Incase you're plooted.
5..> Clan EQ should be 'nodamage'.
6..> Clan EQ should have a keyword of the clan in it's name.  (ie Elysium..etc.)
7..> Clan EQ shouldn't have these flags: nodrop & noremove.  This only harms
     your own members since it's them that use those items the most.
8..> On addaffects for clan EQ:
  a.) Hitroll & Damroll will be considered as one addaffect together.
  b.) Mana & Blood will be considered as one addaffect together and I'd like to
      see those two on every piece, except a clan that doesn't induct
      spellcasters.
  c.) You can bunch addaffects like saving-spell and saving-breath to get -30
      saving-spell OR saving-breath if you wish, but together they still count
      as 2 addaffects since you get the advantage of both.  I'd like to keep
      this bunching down to 2 types at a time and none bunching with damroll.

HQ rules aren't set in stone, so please if you wish to do something different
speak to me.  I'll very likely let you do what you wish as long as it's
reasonable.  And if I won't allow a particular change it's with good reason.
These guidelines to follow were set simply to give some base guidelines to start
from.  They don't tell you how to "dress the stage", but merely how I wish the
"nails to be hammered in".  Anyone who has questions about any of the guidelines
please don't hesitate to speak to me.

Deity Guidelines:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1..> Deities are NOT to enter the HQ of another clan w/o the express permission
     of that clan's deity or one of it's officers.  There have been several
     fights over people doing this.  Consider it common courtesy.  You don't
     want people invading your home, don't invade theirs.
2..> If you find one of your members breaking a rule, don't cover for him, turn
     him in otherwise you'll find yourself paying for the same problem if you
     knew.  Some "favoritism" is allowed, being their mortals in your cult who
     "worship" you, but only within the boundries of what's legal.
3..> Problems between deities are to be settled amoung the ranks of imms.  If
     you have a serious problem with another Deity you feel you cannot solve
     then speak with me.  I'm not going to put up with "catfights" over public
     channels or even semi-public channels.  To roleplay that two PK deities
     hate one another is all well and good, but remember, this IS a game and you
     should be making an effort to work together when out of character.  When
     immortals start carrying their fights over to public channels you make us
     all look bad and for usually very little reason.  Once again..if you have a
     problem you need solved, bring it up with me.

These are all I'm asking for now and I feel every one of them is justified and
is listed because there have been numerous problems in those fields.  I hope you
remember that regardless of my "personal view/feelings" towards you it has no
weight in how I view your performance as a Deity.  Some of you should know this
quite well.  So please don't keep a problem to yourself because you feel I don't
like you.  Truth is, you can hate me all you want, just as long as you do your
job and keep it between us so as not to cause public problems.  Make sense?

Okay, more rules on clans:
  
1) No unclanned mortal character may posses any clan equipment whatsoever.
2) Trading of clan equipment is not allowed until we decide otherwise.
3) All clan equipment has to have the name of the clan set with name.
   That way, we can easily ofind and owhere all clan equipment.
   This does not apply to clan containers or potions.
4) Clan HQs can have more then one exit. However, all exits must lead to
   either Bethaven or Hammerheim.
5) No portals leading out of the HQs are allowed.
6) No blood, hp or mana fountains are allowed in HQs.
7) No Clan equipment under level 30 is allowed.
8) No Clan can give out more then 3 clan items per mortal.
9) Shops, Smithy, Bank, Bloodmob, Water fountains, Healers, Trainers,
   Libraries, Offices for the leaders, Donation boxes, etc are all allowed
   in the HQs.
10) Leveling Mobs or armor/weapon items that can only be obtained in the
    HQs are STRICTLY prohibited!

The Yeti's Hideout~
You were wandering the arctic wasteland for so long before you found
this cave!  Your eyes are still somewhat snow blind and you have no feeling
in most of your body parts.  Inside this cavern, the temperature seems to be
significantly higher than out in the open tundra...  A good place to rest! 
But then you hear some grunting from the far corner of the shelter.  You
wonder what it may be.  Maybe nothing..  You hope.

Arctic Wasteland~
You stand before a cave of ice which emanates waves of chill reaching
into your consciousness threatening to wipe it out.  From inside you hear a
deadly quiet.  It is such a contrast to the howling winds and the blizzard
that rages outside the cave.  You can see a glimmer coming from the crack at
the bottom of the cave entrance.  There seems to be exits north and east and
south.  The cave exit is to the west.

Frozen fields for miles on end.  No one can survive in this weather.
You wonder how you made it this far.  The barren trees seem to howl along

It seems to be less cold in here as well. Near the north wall shines an
