Strife Hall~
Through some crates, boxes, garbage, and more of the type, the small path
from Smoke Street to the side of the warehouse ends.  A thin metal door stands
half open, showing nothing inside other than a noiseless void.  A small
written message has been scrawled into the door.  It reads:  "To the Absolute
Truth".  A flash of light is seen from inside the door.
