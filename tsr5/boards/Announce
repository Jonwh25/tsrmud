I have decided to take TSR down. This is now a MUD ran
by both Akasha and Isaac. I leave this in their hands.
As you can see this is NOT the TSR you were used to.
However, this is based on TSR III code. It has MANY
advantages over the TSR you are used to such as 
multiclassing and a TON of new spells/skills. 
Give it a shot before you decide you hate it.
 
Beo

Subject Introduction :)~
Text
From the days of yore, a child was born in the wilderness.
This child, called Hunter by his parents for being the only
child that was innovative enought to hunt down any problems he
encountered in his life and work, growed more wise and hansom
with the years. 
After his work as a head-enforcer in the Cursed Lands, he
sought new pleasures and new challenges as a headcoder, in
which shape he worked with pleasure for four different 
countries. 
People got to know him as the crazy coder, the caring and
listening friend and the every so justful enforcer and imm.
And now this blue-eyed, easy minded Cleric has entered these
realms, ready to serve all who live here. 
If you need him to help you with anything, you just need to
call for him, or if he is on a trip to other lands, you
can always leave him a note. One of his many habits is always
responding to them.
Beware tho, cross this person and he may turn out to be a 
very honest, but also very strict and sometimes harsh 
enforcer. Treat him with respect and he will return the favor.
Do otherwise and you will feel his wrath and meet with his
psyonic powers. 
For he is called the Hunter, who hunts for love, respect and
loyalty and justice.

Subject Weapons and EQ~
Text
Alright I've heard alot about to much
EQ zapping people. So here's the scoop.
 
This mud had a system for all eq in
which there is anti-everyclass/race.
This is here so you could anti-whatever
for realism on size and class restrctions.
 
Basicly each race has a size Small
medium, human, and large. For example
something meant for a large charcter
would be anti-everything except Ogres
Minotaur, demons and trolls.
 
Also since classes like clerics don't
use certian types of weapons, such as
swords, this allows builder to more
freely build weapons and just restrict
the classes that can't use them rather
than having weapon types.
 
I want peoples opinions on the armor
size thingy though, it does add realisim
but i know it could get annoying as we
add more classes.

Subject Coding~
Text
Okay, our coders know they cannot code atm due to 
implementation of CVS, but due to some unforeseen,
very crashy bugs, I had to pop in and code anyways.
Things done:
 
- Fixxed spell bug, which crashed mud about ever 15 secs
- Wiznet now has a prefix {r[WIZ]{x if you do wiznet prefix
- CVS Scripting environment has been finished. Waiting for
  the new server.
