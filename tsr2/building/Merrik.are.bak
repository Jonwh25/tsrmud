Towards the Eastern Light~
After following the light, and the blood stain, a strong wooden door to the
northeast lays closed. The glowing light that was pouring into the hallway
is coming from the other side of the door and squeezing from the cracks around
the door itself. The blood stain continues in the direction of the door and
gets more dissipated as it goes. The vines on the walls are still there but 
are now going in an upward direction on the walls instead of following the
length of the walls.

End of the Hallway~
Having reached the end of the hallway a the vines that covered the wall 
further north are still there and still look just the same. On the floor there
are some stains of blood that look like a body has been dragged through here.
Oddly enough the stain centers under your feet and leads both east and west.
After followin the length of the stains in both directions it seems that there
is some sunlight coming from the east and west. The glow is dull and barely 
enough to notice but none the less the glows are there.

Towards the Western Light~
Following the light east leads to a very old skeleton. Obviously a humanoid
skeleton, whomever it was had a very nasty death. The skull of the skeleton
is crushed and has several bone fragments all over here. On the wall there 
are more splattered blood stains on the walls the door has something
written on it. From just entering this part of the hallway it is hard to 
discern what exactly is written on it, but it is the color of blood. The door
has light pouring from the cracks surrounding it solving the question of where
the light was coming from.

A Blood Red Room~
Entering this room slowly from the unpleasant warning on the door leading to
itreveals an even more gruesome sight. All the walls and the entire floor has
been stained a very dark red color, obviously from blood, but from whom or what
is undiscernable. All around the floor are bone fragments, and there are even
some imbedded in the vines on the wall. It looks possible to climb up the vines
with ease but after climbing it does not look like it would be possible to come
back down.

Damp Hallway~
This hallway is getting darker the further south it goes. The vines on the
walls are getting thicker and flatter, almost making them look like the walls
probably once did themselves. The feeling in the air has gotten a little more
damp but not too much. The stench of mold is prevalent in the air making 
traveling through this area unpleasant. This hallway is very long but along
the way there is nothing that leads to anything secretive.

In the Down Staircase~
The light in here is annoyingly bright, at least so it seems. After entering
this room from being in a dark hallway the light makes one's eyes hurt. From 
here it is noticable that the tower goes up several more floors but it seems
impossible to go any direction other than back through the door and down.
After some thinking you realize that somewhere else there must be a way to go
up and that this stairway is for going down only. The room has thick vines 
following the distance all the way up the stairwell coming from the hole below
The vines look like they are getting thinner as they go up.

Empty Room~
This room appears to have been part of the security of the tower. On the north
wall there are two bowmans posts that are covered with the vines that seem to 
have taken over the first floor of the tower. The vines have eliminated any
chance of weathering and so the room is perfectly preserved.

Inside the Hall of Vines~
After entering the door consumed by vines it looks as though the rest of the
floor and possibly the entire building has been consumed by these monstrous
plants. Running a hand across them reveals a dense structure and an unusually
slimy skin. Also the vines look like they are getting thicker as they proceed
down further into the tower

Empty Room~
This room appears to have been part of the security of the tower.  On the 
north wall there are long rectangular holes that were probably used to shoot
arrows from to protect the tower when it was till occupied. They are now
covered by vines and completely useless. The rest of the room is completely
void of vines except for a few poking in from the bowmans posts in the wall.
Everything is almost perfectly preserved and there being now dirt on the floor
and the walls are perfect stone.

Inside the Anacreon Tower~
The enterance to the tower feels cool and the ceiling is noticably high 
and has several extravagant pictures painted on it. Towards the other side
the room appears to have been taken over by plant life which explains the 
dank smell in the room. Aside from the vines consuming the room, the walls and
floor are set in stone and are a little damp from the mornings dew. To the
south is a door enveloped by vines and it appears as though it has never been
opened.

Enterance to the 2nd Floor~
After climbing to the second floor a door stands shut to the northeast. From
the door there is a horrid stench that gets worse the closer to the door you 
get. The vines that were so prevalent are still around, but are not as thick
as they were on the floor below. Looking at the ground at where there used to
be an enterance reveals nothing but solid rock. At first panic ensues your 
veins but then dissuades and you relax thinking there must be an exit somewhere

Anacreon's Room of Power~
Upon entrance through the large doors towering bookshelfs line the way to the
end of the room where a small chair and desk have been placed.  The entire
room is so laden with magic that there is no need to detect it.  Everything
usable is glowing brightly.

Dusty Hallway~
In this room the vines that are so prevalent in the floor below have
disbanded to a point of almost being invisible. So now all there is to see is 
some bones scattered here and there and a lot of dust. The size of the granite
that was used to build the tower are now visible and are enormous in size. 
there are exits in many directions all of which are dark.

Before The Large Doors~
To the south of here a set of large doors leave a big impression.  They look
like they lead to something important.  While looking at them there seems to
be symbols on the door.  After picking away the vines you can see hundreds up
upon hundreds of magical symbols that are mostly foreign in design.  It is
obvious that the contents of this room are magical and in many different forms.
