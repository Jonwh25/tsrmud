Watching you carefully from behind thick glasses, this old half-troll

twiddle impatiently on the black book in which she is writing in to.
Giving a wide toothy smile, Luna shifts her position on her chair which
squeaks loudly in the silence.

The Grotto~
The limestone structure of this large cliff that stands before you,
is interrupted by a gentle rush of water coming out of its cave opening.
Sneaking a slight look inside of the cave, you are able to catch a
a glimmer of light coming from within, yet instincts warn you to be wary
of what lies inside and the fear that you might never return.

Looking around, you notice that the glimpses of light that reflect upon
the walls and the massive floor-to-ceiling centre column, are coming from
large rose-shaped torches that intricately line the walls of this chamber.
Observing the water around the column dripping down slowly from the
ceiling, you hear a mixture of echoing noises coming from around you.
From here you see what seems to be a stone stairwell leading you upstairs
to another part of the cave and four other rooms in cardinal directions.

Echos of weapons clanging against heavily suited armor ring through your
ears as you enter this section of the cave. Knowing that within a family
there will be many disputes and confrontations, the members of 
the Rebellion built this area to help relieve the tensions within the clan.
Weapons and armor of different shapes sizes line the stone walls, while

Rules of The `8Rebellion`6.
 
1, Respect each other, you are part of a brotherhood. Any disputes
   within the clan, must be settled immediately, either by fashion of
   consentual battle or a dispute with Bryelle as a mediator.
 
2. Hold your Brothers and Sisters of the clan above all else.
   Any act commited against your fellow clan member must be avenged.
   The more we stick together, the more powerful we shall become.
 
3. Always uphold the balance of the chaos and goodness we have achieved.
   Unlike beliefs, Chaos is neither good or evil. Chaos is corrupted
   by those who are corrupt and evil. Chaos is the state of confusion
   and disorder, in which we must use that state to overpower our enemies.
 
4. Expect the unexpected. Do not trust those outside the clan. 
   Those we are allied with we trust, yet always expect a change in the
   tide. Only your brethren are truly those that you can trust to lay
   their lives for you in battle. As should be within any brotherhood.

Rules of The `8Rebellion`6.
 
5. Honor thy self and thy brethren. Any lack of respect within this clan
   will not be tolerated. Acts such as this will cause the members of
   the Rebellion to retaliate against you, and may end up as dismissal
   from the sector.
 
6. All opinions will be respected. Any ideas regarding plans for the
   clan or the area itself shall be noted to Bryelle.
 
7. Act with Honor in the fields, unless you have been wronged or a member
   has been wronged. If an enemy who has assaulted you or your brethren
   is being kept in safety by an ally, good aligned person, or another
   clan member, at first ask them to release the enemy so you may deal
   with them properly. If the person should not move, you must still
   go after your enemy. Attack them both. For the person is betraying you
   as well.
 
8. Above all keep your faith in the Rebellion. Always speak highly of your 
   clan and its members. Entrust that we shall always guide you to your
   well-being. Help each other as much as possible so that others may
   become as strong as well as you. In the bond we have, our strength
   shall grow.

tomes~
"Her training was complete, and her path had been chosen.
She returned to the world that she had been raised to conquer,
and saw it with the eyes of a healer. She stood in defiance
of everything that her father stood for, and would not rest
until the world was purged of his presence, and all that he
had wrought. She would use his own teachings against him, and
ensure his demise. Lowering her head, she melted into the
shadows, sweeping over the land. She looked down upon it and
saw that were others that would follow, others that would turn
from their conqueror. They would rally under her banner, and
be forged into a new army. Thus did Bryelle begin her rebellion
against Chaos, striking at Beowolf's forces to this very day..",
a voice booms in your head as you open the tome that lays on 
table in this small room, " and there was when her journey began...
Bryelle wandered the land looking at all the destruction that Beowolf's
army had brought upon this world and was saddened by such a sight.
In each town that she visited, always following in her father's path
of destruction, watching and waiting, she spoke with the people never
revealing who or what she truly was. Bryelle listened to their anger
and their pain, feeling their suffering as well. Finally when learning
of their desire to rid the world of such an evil, Bryelle revealed
herself to the people along with the knowledge of her army of Rebellion
and thus she went on to each town gathering those who would stand
by her side against a common foe."

Bedroom~
A deep purple radiance fills this room, the glow coming from within
a single huge, sculpted amethyst dangling from the ceiling.  The
dreamlike atmosphere it creates accentuates the other furnishings, all
glittering with deep violet amethyst inlay.  A huge bed, covered with
wine-colored satin dominates the center of the thickly carpeted room,
directly beneath the magical crystal lamp.  The air is heady with the
scent of violets from purple-stained platinum censers in the four
corners.  You feel strangely relaxed and at peace here...

A Room in Rebellion~
This section of the mountain seems strangely carved out. Many of the
stalagmites and stalagtites have been removed from this room, save for one
large one in the corner of the room. The furnishings in this room are
rather simple, nothing too lavish. A simple bed in the corner opposite the
stalagmite that has not been slept in for ages. Tomes of battle tactics are
strewn about on the floor and you see a rack of finely crafted weapons next
to the bed. A lone chest is at the foot of the bed, keeping a modest
wardrobe. In the floor, there is a single carving: "There is nothing
truer than my blade save my word." To the North, you see a small hole
carved out, leading to a more well-lit area.

This room seems to be more of a study, bookshelves lining the walls, filled
with the wisdom and knowledge passed down by his great mentor, Miirad the
Sage. You see a marvelous desk, crafted out of the finest mithril, also a
gift from his mentor. All on the desk are strewn papers, many discussing
the upcoming stuggles and plans for the Rebellion. A single inviting chair
sits in the middle of the room, a perfect place to rest from the wearies of
the struggle. On the far wall is a fireplace which is almost always going.

The cavern glows with an ethereal light from the solid gold torches
that rise up from the floor to stand well above you. The centre column
in the middle of this room shimmers slightly from the light that reflects
from the dripping water flowing down from the lofty, stalactite-filled 
ceiling. People walking around you look at you with the greatest
of compassion and understanding, for you are now part of their family.
The smooth floor below you gently echos your steps, while you examine
the entryways in the area around you. In exaustion from your long climb
the dripping water that falls down the column invites you to drink in
its nautral refreshment. A large crossroads SIGN stand before you

The light in this area is very low and to the untrained eye it is very
difficult to walk around without stumbling on the cave floor. In the very
corner of your eye, you spot an older gentleman sitting patiently in the
darkness. "Come closer my child, let me give you wisdom in the art 
of languages needed to survive." says the ancient man with a low voice.
In approaching him, you wonder how it was that the man knew of your
entrance into the cave, for Rymar has no eyes in which to see with and
no ears from which to hear from.

Sitting within a circle on the floor, a beautiful woman chants softly in
the darkness. Her red flaming hair moves unnaturally in the air, yet there
are no gusts of wind entering the area. Walking closer towards the circle
in which she sits in, the light finally reflects upon her and you notice
that what you thought was Kassandra's red hair are actually ruby serpents
coming out from the top of her head. Slowly she lifts her eyes to face
you and grins evilly. "What do you wish to practice this eve?" she says
to you with a wicked tone as she stands up to meet your gaze face to face.

This must be a trophy room.  As your eyes further adjust to the dimness,
you see that there are recesses built into the walls.  In each cubicle
is a block of crystal containing a dark, asymmetrical mass....you
realize with growing apprehension that these masses are hearts.  Human
and humanoid hearts...dozens of them, each with a brass plaque bearing a
name.  And one cubicle stands empty, the brass plaque gleaming blankly. 
Whose heart is it for? To the east of here you see a large wooden door.

Walking in the first thing you notice within this room, is that it was
once fashioned in the form of a temple. The stone pedestals, that 
adorned this room, were destroyed by what seems to be a great force
or being. The hand-made statue that once stood proudly in the centre 
of this room, has been smashed to pieces. As far as you can tell, it was
fashioned in the likeness of Bryelle, Goddess of Rebellion. All that 
stands now is a glowing BOOK that has been placed in the area where
the sculpture previously was.

book~
Opening the pages of this book, you begin to read it contents and 
are surprised that the words written start to ring in your ears as
that of a gentle and wise male voice.
 
"I write this to warn you of and give honor to the Goddess of Rebellion,
Bryelle." The voice of Alexandre the cleric rings in your ears as you 
continue to read on. "There came a time. when this glorious city was
young and its people were overjoyed with gratitude towards Bryelle
for making such a place, a place they can call their home. The people
thought that making an Altar, a place to worship their Goddess, would please
the eyes and show Bryelle their gratitude for what she had done for them."
Alexandre's voice sighs heavily and continues, " Day and night they worked
and slaved over making such a temple to honor their Goddess, their savior.
One day when all of Rebellion gathered around to admire the altar and
worship the statue of Bryelle that they had so intricately made, a surge
of lightning came down upon the sculpture and tore it to bits. Instead
stood Bryelle and she addressed her people." In your ears, the voice of
Bryelle booms loudly and speaks sternly, "Do not make unto me these temples
to worship of me, for I am not here to be humbled upon. I am but a 
guidance to thee. Treat me as you will thy brother for that is what I am.
For without its people, Rebellion is nothing , as am I nothing without you."
The voice of Alexandre speaks once more before the book closes, " With 
those words, Bryelle disappeared and as a reminder of her love for her people,
her Brothers and Sisters, this altar stands here, ruined, forevermore..."

Room of Passion and Lust.~
The scent of wild flowers fill your nostrils as you inspect the surroundings.
Your toes tingle at the touch of the fluffy,black carpeting that covers
the area of this suite. Upon a black marble dresser in the corner,
you notice certain items that cater to the pleasures of the body.
Within those items, a bottle of strawberry scented hot-oil, a couple
of red and black feathers, a large bucket of ice, and a variety of
fruits. The red satin bed that sits in the middle of this room looks
very comfortable, but you doubt anyone that rents this particular
room will be getting any sleep.

Honeymoon Suite~
Walking inside you find yourself surprised at the furnishings of this 
suite. Expecting a beautiful hotel suite with white, plush surroundings
and a magnificent view, you are in awe that this room looks more like
a cabin in the woods. A large wood-burning fireplace with a bear-skin
rug placed in front of it, are some of the comfortable yet romantic
views in this room. A bronze canopy bed with a bouquet of roses and a 
bottle of champagne, awaits the newlywed couple.

Above the Cliff.~
Coming outside of the underground city, you have found a lush wooded area.
At the horizon, you see the mountains gently graze the sky and the
landscape of a tropical forest that surrounds the cliff for what seems
to be an eternity. A soft breeze brushes by your hair and in the distance
you hear the sounds of wild birds singing their melodious tune.
Below you, the trail has been made out of wooden planks and divides
in three directions.

The Northern Trail~
Following the trail, this section of the woods is heavily abundant of 
trees and wildlife. Above you the birds graze the sky in peaceful harmony and
take asylum within the protection of the intertwining, heavy branches  
of the plant life. Along the sides of the trail, red, wild strawberries
invite you to feed upon them and taste their juices upon your lips.
Looking further ahead, you can see a fork in the road.

surrounding you seems to be densening with the plant life and very little
light is able to enter. Up ahead you can barely make out a structure in the

with the beautiful wild flowers of the area. At the floor of the chapel,
luxuriant black and white roses grow to enhance the beauty of this scene.
Placed here by the `8Rebellion`6, this church is intended for the people
to celebrate the union of Holy Mudtrimony. Any members wishing to wed
must speak with Bryelle, so that she may perform the ceremony.

Forest End~
You seemed to have come to an area of the forest that had been blocked
off by an immense tree that has fallen to the ground. Large piles
of the tree's leaves are scattered on the floor and the eerie noise
of the crackling of your footsteps upon them makes you turn back.

Room of the Holy Wrath~
You have just entered a stunning room,  the room is carved out of 
quartz and reflects the light from the stalgmites on the ceiling.
In the center of the room is a large bed veiled in a curtain of 
deep midnight blue satin dappled in gold moons and stars.  A matching
coverlet adorns the bed and pillows the colors of twilight rest
against the wraught iron headboard.  A rosewood desk is against the
south wall with a comfy chair to match the bedcurtains to sit upon. 
A large clawfooted bathtub is in the southeastern corner of the room
filled with steaming fragrant water.  In the southwestern corner is
a perch for a bird.

the small porch you see some wooden rocking chairs next to each other 
and a swing hanging at the opposite end. Walking up the steps and 
reaching the front door, you notice a black metal mailbox to the left
full with mail that has not been picked up. 
You look down and notice the welcome mat and decide to wipe your feet
before knocking at the door.

Inside the Cabin~
Walking inside of the cabin belonging to Bryelle, nothing is as you 
would expect it to be. A large bookshelf sits in the corner of this room
heavily lined with what seems to be hundreds of books. Ranging from
fiction to non-fiction, she has Biographies, Art books, music books,
and what seems to be a series of books called the "Inner Mind and Soul."
In front of the bookshelf a large bearskin rug is laid down before a
comfortable lounging chair. Nearby a roaring fireplace burns warming
the room, making it quite comfortable. Above the fireplace, collections 
of rare items from the land, gently shimmer in the firelight beside the 
champagne glasses that await to be filled with sweet tasting champagne.
Something about this room and the surroundings makes you think that
Bryelle is one to not be taken lightly nor judge.
