A small green baby lies here hungrily awaiting the return of its mother,

to wag its tail as it spots a familiar shape in the air.

Malphaydes Toy Room~
This room is filled with a numerous amount of strange toys. It is easy
to tell that the master of this room has lost his mind from the eccentric
decor that abounds. Teddy bears with nasty pointed blood-soaked teeth 
fill the shelves, as do demented-looking rag dolls who wield their
various missing appendages as weapons. Obviously the work of a madman.

A Rocky Clearing~
Emerging from the forest the light is much brighter here. There is 
nothing to block the increase in the brightness of the light, save
the boulders that lie strewn about. These giant rocks are imbedded
deep into the ground. It is most likely that they have fallen from
the peaks of The Dragon's Teeth that loom off in the west.

Bottom of the Mountain~
The path starts its acsent into the mountains on a very steep incline.
The small hills that were abundant a second ago are now replaced with
sheer faces of rock climbing upward towards the sky. The green of the 
grass covered hilltops has been replaced with a deep earthy tan color.

Halfway up the Mountain~
The path has now become no more than a mere ledge twisting southwest
around the side of the mountain. It looks as though someone may have fallen
from here by the amazing amount of scuff marks on the edge of the trail.
Looking downward a pile of bloodstained rocks lay at the base of the cliff,
as an example of what happens to those who do not watch their step.

The Plateau~
The ground has finally leveled back off, and now stretches out west as
far as the eye can see. The peaks known only as the Dragon's Teeth race
skyward to the north and the south. It is now evident why these peaks 
bear that name. They are so twistedly gnarled and jagged that they 
resemble actual dragon's teeth.

The Gates of Dalakduum~
The stone gates of the dwarven stronghold Dalakduum lie here. The gates are
carverd from two massive slabs of granite. Each of which is three feet thick
These mighty gates are here to help protect the stronghold from invaders. 
It is hard to imagine how anyone could pass through these stone gates if
they were unwelcome here.

A Mountain Stream~
Water rushes from the side of the mountain. It trickles and slowly forms
a small stream. This is obviously one of many mountain springs that the 
dwarves of Dalakduum use for their water supply. The water is as clear
and sparkling as the gems that are harvested from the mines in the depths
of the mountains below.

Base of the Tooth~
Looking upwards there is no conceivable way that this peak can be climbed
it is just too jagged to be traversed, but after staring blankly at the
base of this misshapen stone a set of handholds and footholds begin to emerge
from the mangled formation of rock. It is now easy to see how to climb the 
peak.

Base of the Tooth~
After closer inspection this tooth is not near as rough and twisted as
it's sibling to the north. This peak has a very well developed marked 
path leading up the side of the spire. Traveling along this path will 
not be nearly as hard as climbing the rough face of the other one.

A Mighty Oak~
A lone Oak tree stands here blowing in the tremendous wind the blow
in the mountains.  The branches sway back and forth bending to extremes
as the gusts of wind try to snap them. At the base of the trunk the roots
penetrate deep into the hard rocky earth below. This tree seems to thrive
here in these harsh conditions, just like the dwarves who planted it.

Top of The Teeth~
At this altitude the air is very thin, and it is very hard to breathe.
The mist from the clouds in the sky make the air very moist and humid.
There is very little here at the top of this peak, except for a very large 
nest made of wood and stone. High shrilled cries can be heard emanating
from the nest.

Up the Teeth~
Climbing the tooth is harder than expected, even with the handhold and
footholds that are present. From this height there is an excellet view of
the realms. Back to the east lies the magnificent City of Shadows, and to
the north lie the dark woods of the Haon Dor forest.

Trail up the Tooth~
It is uncanny how natural this path looks. It almost looks as if it were
part of the mountain peak itself, but that is impossible it is just to 
smooth and oerfect to be a naturally occuring trail. From the amount of
dwarven craftsmanship that has gone into this path, there must be something
truly spectacular at the top.

the ground beside the campfire. There is also large cauldron resting upon

The Battlements~
At this corner of the battlements part of the wall is missing. A siege
was most certainly attempted at this location, because the wall is 
cracked and slowly crumbling. The aged stone is not in very good condition.
Erosion has also taken its toll upon this mighty defensive structure. If
this wall is not fixed soon it will collapse.

The whole plateau can be seen from up here. It all seems much more serene
from this height. The small stream that begins down on the plateau can 
now be seen snaking its way down the mountainside as a large river. More 
streams feed into the main one to steadily increase its size. It is a 
truly breathtaking sight.

go. There is also a small table here where the guards like to relax,
smoke and gamble. One of the guards has carelessly left his lit pipe
here burning away and wasting his precious tobacco.

The heavy odor of dwarven pipe tobacco floats in from the north and 
south accompanied by a thick smoke. The cloud of smoke twists and 
contorts itself into many unique designs as it reaches out from one 
end of the room to the other. As the cloud of smoke slowly dissipates
a new one rolls in from the north.

The echoed sound of footfall upon the stone floor makes the room seem much

from wall to wall like an endless sea. The floor is polished so well that it

room makes it seem full of tranquility and peace just like the ocean in its

The Roof of the Guard House~
The top of this guard house has been turned into a surveillance
area. Two large spyglasses are mounted to the wall. One of them
is pointed towards the world below on the outside of the stronghold, 
and the other one is pointed towards the entrance to Dalakduum's mine.
The mine is watched very closely, because occasionally an orc will escape
from the mountains' depths where they dwell.

An overpowering musty smell dominates this room. This place is only ventured
into by the dwarven guards when they are absolutely out of something and 
it can be found no other place. It has been said that this room is haunted.
Many of the guards go home to thier families and tell them of the ghastly
shade that they have seen wandering amongst the boxes of stored food.

No light penetrates the thick forest ceiling in these woods, it is 
literally pitch black.  All that can be seen are vague outlines of gnarled
twisted shapes which are probably trees, but one of the shapes moved, did
it not? High pitched snickering can be heard coming from the surrounding
darkness. The leaves shift and crackle under something's feet, what could
it be?.

The remains of a fire lie here half extinguished. These coals put an eerie
glow in this intense darkness. This fire puts off a large amount of light
considering the intensity of the darkness here. Trees can actually be made
out here as well as the grass on the forest floor. Once again the world 
seems full of life in this sanctuary from the otherwise pitch black 
conditions.

Darkness~
In this spot of this extremely dense forest, darkness seems to be more of
an entity than just the absence of light. Here darkness has a texture and 
a life of its very own. It is as if the darkness itself is alive. It seems
that an entity of this kind is most certainly not natural. It must have been
created and placed here for a specific purpose. The only semblance of light 
is an eerie red glow to the north.

A Quiet Corner~
Amongst the noisy atmosphere of this tavern it is nice to find a quiet
spot. All of the booths are empty here except for one, which is a surprise
considering how busy this place is. The area seems to be reserved for those 
patrons who simply want to drink their ale and smoke thier pipe in peace.
The solitary booth that is occupied holds a lonely dwarf smoking his pipe,
and quietly looking on at the crowd.

exquisite piece of oak, and the finish makes it shine like a star in the 
sky. The gold inlay depicts a battle between a group of dwarves and a 
dragon. On the back wall near where the ale is kept a rack of mugs hangs

The Streets of Dalakduum~
The wealth of this stonghold is now apparent by the lavish conditions 
of its many buildings and streets. The buildings are either made from
granite or oak, and they are kept in pristine condition. The frames of
the windows are inlayed with either gold or silver. The roads are made 
from polished stones that are so expertly put together that it is nearly
impossible to find where one stone ends and a new one begins.

with music and song. The band somberly beats and blows out their tune on 
their drums and flutes as they tap their feet to the beat. The drunks 
stagger around and bellow out their off-key war hymns at the top of their
lungs.

to relax after a long day of work in the mines. or at the forge. The place
is packed wall to wall with customers. A sign on the wall boasts the best 
ale in all the realms. To the north the off-key singing of drunken dwarves
can be heard.

Midtown Dalakduum~
The loud noise of drunken dwarves singing warhymns rolls in from the 
north. The sign on the door reads 'Galakor's House of Ale.' Obviously a 
favorite hangout of the locals. The strong aroma of tobacco drifts in from
the south. Large twists of tobacco hang in the window. The sign on the 
window reads 'Balor's Pipes.' The heart of the city lies to the west.

A Large Fountain~
The street widens to make room for the gigantic fountain that is here.
Water shoots a good five feet into the air before it begins its return 
to the ground. The fountain pool is made out of solid stone and is roughly
a half a foot deep. The fountain itself is made from a gigantic diamond.
The diamond is cut to perfection and tunnels have been very delicately 
carved into the facets of the gem so that the water will flow through it.
It is a breathtaking site when the sun hits the fountain, it sparkles and
shines as bright as the sun. To the north lies a beautiful flower garden.

except for one fact. That fact is that they were made in the Luckbringer 
forge. This forge's products are know for their durability and for their
excellent craftsmanship. People come from far and wide just to place an
order here.

The Anvils~
Three huge anvils stand here awaiting to be worked on. These anvils must 
weigh at least three hundred pounds a piece. They are placed very near
the hearth so that the blacksmith will have easy access to the bed of
coals. There are also large tubs full of water here placed next to the
anvils on the side opposite of the hearth. This is the ideal setup for
hammering metal. The smith has to make very few movements except for
pounding and shaping the steel he is working on.

The Forbidden Tower~
This tower is a place that all dwarves fear and avoid at all costs. It
houses those of their race that choose to practice magic. Those dwarves
who dare commit such an act know the consequences of their actions. Those
few who have chosen that path become outcasts, and end up finding a safe
haven here. This place is closely guarded by only those of the most solemn
mind, because this exile is a punishment and the inhabintants of the tower 
cannot be allowed to escape and pollute the rest of the society with their
treachery.

Before the Mine~
The mine lies to the west. The path worsens even more in that direction.
Very few traces of the road are left. The road has become no more than a
very rough and rocky trail towards the entrance to the mine shaft. The 
decay of the road is due to the miners dragging their mining picks on the
ground behind them. The road also continues to the north.

The Alley~
This path has seen much wear and tear from the fall of many feet. The
road is cracked and broken. Good sized chunks are missing from it in 
several places. The only thing that makes the road look decent is the 
lovely flower bed planted along the sides. Some caring person has taken 
the time to plant an extensive variety of flowers. The flowers are
untouched. The people who travel this road obviously like and respect
the attempt someone has made at brightening their day.

Downtown Dalakduum~
The main road is crossed by an alley that goes north. The alley that leads
to the north seems very well traveled, and a very tall tower dominates 
the landscape in that direction. The sound of a smith's hammer pounding
red-hot metal is audilbe from the Luckbringer forge to the south. Further 
on in the west lies a large home, it is noticeably larger than the others
in the city. Someone of importance must reside there.

Entrance to the Luckbringer Forge~
This building is a place of myth and legend. The weapons and armor made
at this forge are known throughout the realms as some very well crafted
goods. The building has multiple chimneys, indicating a large bed of coals.
The building was orginally smaller, but when it was rebuilt many years ago
the size of the hearth was made larger so that the smiths would have more
room to work so that all of them would not be huddled around the same bed of
coals fighting over who gets to use the anvil first.

The Luckbringer Forge~
This is the forge that Rhylus Luckbringer accidently destoyed when 
attempting to make his first sword. It was rebuilt soon thereafter as 
an honor to him. The loud clanging of steel against steel accompanied by
a dwarvish work song can be heard all around. To the west is a dwarven male
selling shields and suits of armor. To the east is a young dwarven female
selling a wide variety of arms. From the south the glow of the mighty hearth
casts a fiery orangish-red glow this way.

The Hearth~
Flaming hot coals line the bed of this enormous hearth. A half-finished
sword is being tempered to increase its strength. The coals crackle and 
hiss around the cold blade. A large cloud of smoke rises up from the icy
blade while it heats up again so that the steel becomes malleable once
more. Stray sparks from the coals fly around within the hearth as if they
were playing a game of tag. One of the sparks shoots out of the safety of
the bed of coals, and falls to the floor where it extinguishes itself.

Entrance to the Mine~
A large cavern opens up and descends deep into the heart of the mountain.
The ladder down to the mine shaft is lit only by a few lanterns, and 
torches. This mine is the source of all of Daladuum's enormous amount of 
wealth. It is also a place of great danger, because many things lurk in the
lower levels of the mine. There is a small sign posted by the entrance to the
mine.

Along the Road~
The doors to the jail lie to the north. The doors are made from heavy 
iron, and they seem to be very thick. A large brass door knocker hangs
on the door underneath a peep hole. The curious thing about this door is 
that there is no way of opening it from the outside. There is no handle on
the door, as a matter a fact there does not even seem to be hinges for the
door to open on. The doors seem more a part of the wall than a set of doors.

luster brightens the entire room. The reflection from the hearth off
of the many polished suits of armor creates a dancing glow about the room
These pieces of armor are so well made that there is no visible way that 
the separate plates can be seen to be held together to from a suit. Truly
the dwarven blacksmiths that work here have mastered their craft.

There are four different piles here, each one for a specific ore. There is
one for gold, silver, bronze, and steel. It is from here that the blacksmiths
select the hunk of ore that they will turn into a magnificent piece of 
crafstmanship.

This point on the road begins the residential section of Dalakduum. 
Houses spread out to the reaches of the horizon. Immediately to the west
is a very large dwelling. The sign out front says that it is the home of
Thoralan Dorlak the ruler of this great stronghold for many years now. 
This red stone house is very ancient. It is one of the oldest buildings 
in the city.

like some sort of animal broth. The size of the stove is enormous. It is
at least four feet wide and deep. The sink is filled with warm water for
washing the towering pile of dirty dishes that rest upon the counter. 
The remains of a boar lie on the cutting board waiting to be put in the
oven and cooked.

Inside the Dorlak home~
For being the home of a ruler this place is pretty plain. This entrance 
is decorated in a very rustic way. Trophy heads from victorious hunts 
hang upon the wall. A woven rug covers the length of the entire floor.
The rug is made from the softest cotton threads known in the realms. It
feels like walking through a grass that is as light as air. The smell of
stew floats in from the kitchen to the north, and a crackling fire can 
be heard to the west.

constructed from raw obsidian. Each step has been polished and sanded,
so that all the rough edges are gone. Such an exquisite job has been 
done that it appears as the bumps and rough edges of the stairs were
worn away naturally over a long period of time. At the bottom of the 
banister there is a bust of Thoralan carved into it.

duties. This level of this ancient building is much larger than the

It is here that all of Dalakduum's rulers have lived for the last three
hundred fifty years.

he can be himself. In the corner a fishing pole rests unused for some
time now. It was from a simpler time, when as a boy his father used to 
taking him fishing at one of the underground lakes inside the mountains.
It is here that Thoralan comes in his times of leisure to escape his

nothing else the rulers of Dalakduum are know to be fair and just to all

the flames' aura gives off more light than the flame.

The cavern tunnel widens to about five feet wide here. This is the 
first part of the cavern that the dwarves began mining many years ago.
That would explain the extreme wideness of this tunnel. Scrapes from 
mining pick adorn the mine walls. The mining stopped in this shaft just 
after the dwarves found a richer deposit of minerals and stone. The 
light grows stronger to the west as does the sound of dwarven grumbling.

This is where the miners get their light source for the long day of work

pile of lanterns. There are actually two seperate piles of lanterns. One of
them is for the those dwarves who are going to work, and the other pile is
where those dwarves who are coming off a shift drop off their empty lanterns
so that they can be refilled with oil for the next shift.

around a small table. On the table is a large pot of dragon's root tea. The
walls are covered with maps that show which part of the caverns have been 
mined ad which tunnels have yet to be mined. To the north is the door to

lound clanging of the mining picks is in time with the beat of the 
miners work song. A large wheelbarrow full of ore is resting here 
waiting to be taken to the ore smelter for processing. To the north is

the wall sparkles from the light given off by the miners lanterns. The 
gem miners that work here do not use mining picks. They have to use much
more delicate means to extract these precious stones from their rocky beds.
The loud sound of mining picks is replaced by the soft tapping of chisels.
This sort of mining takes longer than mining ore, and it is much more taxing
on both the body as well as the mind.

gives off the light of a thousand lanterns. This contraption melts away 
the rock part of the ore so that only the mineral remains. Once the mineral
has been extracted and cooled it is taken to the lift where it is hoisted 
up to the surface.

the orcs beats out a rythym on the disembodied head of a dead miner. The
fire reaks of the stench of death. Upon closer inspection this fire serves
two purpose. It serves as a way for the orcs to cook their dead, and it 
also serves as a way for them despose of the remains of their prisoners
when they no longer have a use for them.

A Pit~
At the bottom of this pit there is no light the only thing that is 
visible are the five pairs of glowing red eyes staring in this direction
from the north. The rank odor of this place is overpowering, only one thing
could smell this bad, Orcs! The light shining down from the mineshaft is so
bright that it hurts to look at it.

The Pen~
This is where the orcs keep their dwarven prisoners. At least fifteen 
wounded dwarven miners lay bleeding in this pen. These prisoners moan
in agony as they await their grizzly end. The pen is a cage about ten 
feet deep. The orcs do not even bother to lock the pen. There is no way 
that these battered dwarves could escape, because they have harldy enough
blood left in their viens to make their heart pump let alone escape.

The Pigpoles~
Here up on pigpoles are the decaying corpses of four slain dwarves. 
Three of these mutilated dwarves were miners, but the other one bears 
the uniform of a mine guard. The mine guard and one of the miners were
killed just recently, because blood still drips from their open wounds 
to the cold cavern floor. Wait a minute, one of the miners is still 
twitching. These slaughtered dwarves stand as an example of what happens
to those who trespass in the orcs' territory.

Up the Stairs.~
The long trek to the top of this mysterious tower begins at the bottom
of these large stairs. The plush red carpet continues up this mighty 
spiraling case of stairs. When an initiate climbs these stairs for the
first time they are accompanied by an elder member of the outcast dwarves.
It is at this time that the newly exiled dwarves are told a brief history 
of the forbidden tower and the dwarven mages that have lived here throughout
the ages.

A Laborious Climb~
At this point the stairs become very steep. The is the first of many
tests that await the initiates in their new life here in the forbidden
tower. The stairs suddenly change into a sheer face of rock, and now
completely untraverseable by ordinary means. This test is merely one of
wits and base magical skills. This test helps to determine whether or
not the initiate was rightly exiled here. If the dwarf fails the test
and does not make it to the next level of the stair they will be returned
to the outside world so that they can have their normal life back.

Past the Test~
The stairway once again returns to normal. The top of the stairs can be 
seen from here only a short climb away. At this height the Forbidden Tower
has risen a good three hundred feet into the skies above Dalakduum. The 
city itself cannot be seen because of the amount of cloud cover that 
sorrounds the tower, but the bustle of the busy dwarves can be heard from
below.

The Smoking Lounge~
The room is filled with small cots where the shop's customers may relax,
and smoke their pipe is they so desire. There is a table in center of the
lounge filled with samples of the newest kinds of tobacco for sale. This
rooms smells like freshly cut tobacco. On the south wall is a painting of
the Dragon's Teeth mountain chain.

Top of the Stairs ~
Finally those blasted stairs have ended. At least those stairs were there
a minute ago weren't they. Now there is a lovely rug in the spot the stairs
were previously. This room is cozily decorated with a large fireplace in 
the corner. It is keeping the room at quite a comfortable temperature. 
There is something very peculiar about this raging fire, and that is there
is no fuel of any sort beneath it. The flames also burn a bright violet that
casts an enchanting shade of lavender upon the room while it dances about 
the walls.

The Library~
This is the library of the mages of the Forbidden tower. The bookcases
reach up to the ceiling. On each wall there are two of these giant 
bookcases. The volumes contained upon the shelves are filled with spell
after spell. These mages that live here spend many an hour here studying,
and researching spells. There are also several plush leather reading 
chairs here for the comfort of those who choose to spend their time here.

Several couches lie here ready to be occupied. This is where the mages of 
the Forbidden Tower come when they are not studying and need to relax. There
is a wide variety of teas and herbal drinks available for refreshment. The
couches are made from solid quartz, and the cushions are made from dragons
scales and they are stuffed with feathers from a griffin. They look very
comfortable.

A Shrine to the Dead~
This room seems to float here apart from the foundation of the others.
The floor sways back and forth with the movements of the air currents. A
large tapestry floats next to the east wall. It depicts the tragic death of
a young unidentified dwarf. Globes of electricity hover in the shape of a 
triangle near the center of the room. The globes illuminate the room with an
intense light that is second in brightness only to the sun. An extremely
old and large book sits on a pedastal in the corner of the room.

tapestry~
This wall hanging tells the story of how the forbidden tower came into
being. It tells the story of the banishment of Kalinor Drakner one of the
few magic users in Dalakduum. At the time fo his banishment he was but a 
boy. He would sneak away to the store room on top of the guard house to
practice his spells. After a few years of this Kalinor was getting pretty
good at it, but he was careless. One day he forgot to see if anyone else
was in the store room. There was a stock boy working quietly in the corner
when something went wrong. Kalinor accidentally spoke the wrong word, and 
out of no where A vortex of lightening appeared. The lightening scorched 
the room and killed the poor stock boy the minute it hit him. The room 
smelled of seared flesh. In a panic Kalinor bolted for his home, but it was
already to late guards were already rushing to the store room in answer to 
the gut wrenching screams that had preiviously filled the air. The guards
seized Kalinor and put him in the jail. From that moment on he was an outcast,
as all dwarven magic users are. No one felt safe, so the people of Dalakduum
built this tower to house Kalinor and all those like him for all time.

An Emerald Portal~
Unknown to the rest of the city, those exiled can leave the tower at
anytime. It is through this portal that the mages do all their travelling.
From here the mages can leave their place of exile and travel incognito 
amongst those who imprisoned them here. The portal ripples like a pool of
water after a pebble has been cast into the center of it. The unearthly
green glow of the portal makes it almost appear as it is part of the 
limestone wall.

The Archmage's Chamber~
It is here that the eldest Archmage conducts lessons and practice sessions
for his pupils. The room is filled with magical amulets to help the students
focus and hone their magical skills. In the far corner are a pair of 
practice dummies heavily abused by overuse. The one on the right is burnt
and singed from lightening bolts and fireballs. The one on the left is 
almost frozen solid from the repeated chill touches and ice blasts.

Kyra's Flower Garden~
There is a lovely flower garden here that is planted in neat, straight
rows.  The many different kinds of flowers make a rainbow with their
varied colors.  With so many types of flowers, their aromas could be
overpowering, but not here.  Kyra has taken care to make sure that all
of the flowers compliment each other.  Over on the east side of the
garden is an important looking area of red roses.  Rumor has it that
Kyra put those roses in her garden in tribute to her true love.

The foreman's desk lies in shambles in the center of the room. Piles and
piles of orders for minerals are stacked up to the ceiling. A work schedule
is posted on the wall for both the miners and the mine guards. A large
map of the known mountain caverns is hanging of the west wall. Large red 
dots denote the places where dwarves have disappeared from. A big mug of
warm ale from the tavern sits upon the foreman's desk untouched.
