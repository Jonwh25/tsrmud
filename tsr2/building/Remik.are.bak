Port of Dhabsin~
Entering the Port of Dhabsin, it is easily noticed that this port is
home to a number crews.  To the slight northeast the port continues
as it follows the creastline of the island.  In that direction are a
number of ships, including one that stands out.  Its brilliantly bright
colors include red, gold, yellow, and purple.  To the west, the port 
continues.  Along that path are a number of ships as well.  However,
none boast of such prestige as the vessle to the northeast.  In either
direction you can continue, as well as to the southeast to what looks to
be the port shop.

Port of Dhabsin~
A small path, following the creast of the ocean leads you here.  This 
is the northern most tip of the port, as the walk ends abruptly at a
ship of certain status.  Although it cannot be reached to inspect 
because of the line of pirates that guard its entrace, they allow
visitors to admire the beauty of the shit.  The high sailing flags of
the ship wane slightly in the wind, as the bold colors of its decks
shine in the light.  A large insignia on the side of the main deck is
readily appearant, and brings much to wonder about the captain of the
ship.  The insignia, in the form of a nonagon, has the cruelst look 
about it.  From first a first glance it looks much like a skull inside
a circle, but a more careful look brings more detail to the eye.  From
the end of the walk, southwest is the only way it looks exitable.

Port of Dhabsin~
A small walkway from the main entrance of the port leads to here.  It 
ends abruptly, meeting with sandy sandy soil.  The air smells of the 
ocean, and the sight resembles much the same.  Vessles of many sizes
have reached this dock and surely call it home.  Some even look to have
been abandoned.  Back east seems to be the only real way to adventure
while further west a wide beach makes its way next to the waters.

Path to Dhabsin~
The entrance to the small village of Dhabsin begins here.  Much lore
and history tells the average traveler strange things about this land.
Not much is known, however.  The people of this village have sworn
against all its accusations and testify that they have no knowledge of
the tales.  A small dirt path with patches of grass lines the way into
the main street of the village to the south.  Slightly south and just
east is what looks to be the port shop, where travelers buy supplies
and other such goods for travel.  To the north are the docks of Dhabsin,
leading off the Island of Habus.

Path to Dhabsin~
A small dirt and grass path has been made to the entrance of this small
inhabitancy.  Just off the east of the path is what looks to be the 
port shop.  Travelers and villagers alike pass through the doors in
every hour of the day.  This town is a town that never sleeps, so to 
speak.  To the south of here, the path continues, heading off to the 
west a bit farther down.  Still, to the north, the port of Dhabsin
remains, awaiting travel by a number of people.

Entrance to Dhabsin~
Along the traveled path comes a sign.  The weathered wood of the sign
shows the age of the village as well as the general upkeep.  The walk
ends it path to the south and now faces west.  Small houses and huts
populate the view to the south.  Off in the far south, it is possible
to make the outline of something of importance in the village.  Perhaps
a central hall or town meeting spot.  From here, the only exit possible
without trespassing is west.

Road in Dhabsin~
Passing several small town houses, the path leads here.  The village,
as far as anyone can see, happens to be very small compared to some of
the bigger towns on other other lands.  The path heading west makes a
turn to the south, as more and more huts are passed.  The entire village
can be seen from here, as this portion of the road is slightly elevated.
To the southeast, a large group of houses are surrounding a spherical
building.  However, from here, the only exit is south.

Road in Dhabsin~
Passing a couple more small houses, the path makes a few turns while
continuing south.  To the south, a very large tree can now be seen, as
it takes up much of the view.  To the east, much of the scattered town
can be see, as well as the majority of the large gathering of houses,
surrounding the spherical shaped mass.  To the south you can continue on
a direct path to the tree, or head east, towards the gathering.

At a Tree~
Passing a single house to this point, it is readily appearant that
this road leads to the tree ahead.  With each passing step, the tree
grows larger and larger.  Once at the tree, it is noticeable that
the inside has been hollowed out, and looks as if it can be entered.
Glancing at the tree, it looks to be quite healthy, as its limbs feature
hundreds of thousands of green leaves.  One limb, however looks to droop
lower than the rest and has no leaves.  Inspecting further could bring
more details to the light.  In the far east, the gathering of houses can
be seen, as well as a large circle of nothing off to the far southeast.

limb~
The limb is much different from the rest of the tree.  The limb itself
doesnt even look like a regular limb.  It looks to be mechanical, if
that is, in fact, possible.  Inspecting upon the spot where the tree
and limb meet on the trunk, it can be detected that this limb isnt
a limb at all, but a switch.  By pushing or pulling on the limb, some
sort of device may or may not be activated.  Use at your own discretion.

Road in Dhabsin~
Passing little more than one hut, travel along this road is of not
much consequence.  Few things are taken into view other than the 
obvious destination that this road leads to.  Its amazing that this
town has no more than a single road and inhibits this many people.
On top of that, its a port town, but much smaller than a normal port
city.  Looking toward the south, a large circle has been burned out
of the grass, but contains nothing.  Exit from here lead east and west.

Road in Dhabsin~
Entering upon the gathered houses, it can be seen now that this is
some sort of village council place.  The noble houses of the village
gather round in a square type formation around a spherical building.
The building and square in general do not look to be active at the
current time as no one can be seen entering or exiting anything.  Not
even as much as sound can be heard.  Exits from here are to the south,
just on the inside of the square; east, just on the inside of the
square; and back west.

Inside the Square~
Houses, varying little in size, line the northern row of the square.
They run in a straight line and hit a ninety degree angle, heading due
south from there.  Just to the south from this point, all that is 
noticeable is the spherical building.  While it boasts to be spherical,
it isnt exactly that.  The base seems wider than the top, and the sides
don not conform to the exact standards of a regular circle.  Its appearance
and overall 'feel' do not look as if it is a very inviting structure.
Exits from here head south, towards the entrance of the building; and
west, towards the entrance of the square.

Inside the Square~
Houses line just to the west and south of this spot.  A large spherical
building is just east and looks rather uninviting.  No signs of life
can be seen anywhere from here, as the air is dead with silence.  A small
clearing in between two houses has been made, and forms a small, rather
obscure path southeast.  And while noticing that, another path, much
similar to the southeastern one, heads slightly southwest.  So, from here
the choices to travel are numerous.

Entrance to Building~
Still, as detected before, no life can be seen entering or exiting 
from this part of town.  To the immediate west lies the entrance to
this spherical building.  The doors that lead into the building boast
of purple colors and have a gasseous look about them.  Upon further
detection, it can be noticed that a pull chain exists just off to the
left of the door.  North and south are the only obvious exits from this
spot.  However, west is a potential possibility.

Inside the Square~
Upon the south side of this square, houses are lined up.  These houses,
much unlike the others found in town, these look exceptionally upkept.
Peering into a house reveals that the houses are fully furnished and
look to have been used very recently.  Perhaps this square isnt as dead
as it once seemed.  From here a door on the eastern wall of the building
can be seen to the north, as well as the western wall of the square to
the west.

Obscure Path~
A light path, more than likely unintentional, has been made heading
due southeast.  The path, which leads to what looks to be another 
clearing, shows sign of little life, as the brown grass and silence
make this very clear.  A small path from the southwest can also be
seen, joining at the clearing where this path connects.  Exits from
here are to the southeast and to the northwest.

Obscure Path~
A small, obscure path of some sort has been created here.  As obscure
as it may be, however, its destination can be seen clearly.  Just to
the south a large circle clearing has been made.  The grass about this
general area is on the edge of death, as most of the area has a brownish
look to it.  A stench can also be detected upon nearing the circle, 
giving a warning sign for visitors to keep out.  From here it is possible
to continue south to the circle or north into the square of houses.

Circle of Death~
Entering upon this circle, it is appearant that people are not wanted
here.  Small, wooden stumps surround the circle with daggers stabbed
into them.  A fresh many corpses lie in the center of the circle, rotting
from time.  Writing on one of the stumps on the southern threshhold of
the circle may reveal more details or perhaps a formal warning.  A light
path has been created, whether intentional or not, to the east, heading
into yet another clearing.  Exits from here are east or north.

Warning:  The Death Circle is off limits to visitors and townfolk alike.
Only the nobles are to enter this place.  This is where the dead are 
rested and left for the wild forces of nature to take care of.  This
ancient tradition applies to natives and vistors alike.  To break this
holy rite would anger the evil spirits of the highlands and the town
will be punished.  Those attemting to interfere will be executed.
 
-Bahlk, Head Priest of Dhabsin.

Circle of Nothing~
Upon entering this circle of burnt grass, something strikes you as
being wrong.  The way the earth looks, or the way that it seems.  
Something certainly is out of place.  In the center of the circle, a
very small hole lies.  Its dimensions are about one inch by an inch.
West of here lies another circle, however, that circle is filled with
corpses of former townies.  From here you can either head west into that
circle, or you can head northwest on an obscure path to a group of
houses.
