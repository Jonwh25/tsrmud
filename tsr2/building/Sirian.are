Overgrown Path~
This beaten path winds through the jungle-trees here, twisting in and out
of the shadows created by the canopy overhead.  Vines and other strange
plants hang down, obscuring vision, and a blanket of dew deadens sounds.
The air is warm and humid, but comfortable, and the smells of things
growing is pleasant.

Overgrown Path~
The path here is of beaten dirt, liberally covered with fallen leaves and
twigs from the surrounding jungle-trees.  Some of the smaller bushes and
shrubs carry flowers or fruits, such as the sweet kirgafruit.  A damp
warmth permeates everything here, making the area seem quiet and remote.

Overgrown Path~
Shadows line the path here, creating a cozy darkness under the trees'
canopy.  The beaten dirt path runs between the trees and through the
underbrush, creating a twisting path of sorts.  The air is thick and
warm with moisture and carries the scent of growing plants.

Rock in Path~
The path here widens into a small clearing, in the center of which stands
a round boulder, 7 feet tall and almost 5 feet wide.  A layer of dust or
ash covers the ground and the boulder, though many tracks criss-cross their
way through the it.  The rock, however, seems untouched by man or animal.
The path narrows and leads on to the east and the southwest.

~
The rock is of a lightly-pored black stone, very different from the
surrounding pebbles and stones of gray rock.  Whatever put this rock here
must have done it a VERY long time ago, judging by the thickness of the dust
covering it.
~
E
Dust Ash~
The dust here is surprisingly thick, and seems to cover everything from
the stone in the midle of the path to the broad leaves of the near-by
foilage.  The dust is, upon getting a closer look, very fine and seems to
have been settled here for quite some time.
~
E
Rock Stone Boulder~
The boulder here is just over 7 feet tall and 5 wide.  It sits in the center
of this cleared space in the jungle.  No birds or animals sound in the brush
here, and the rock seems to have an almost tangible aura of power.

#4904
Overgrown Path~
Heavy vines and creeper plants snake their way down from the branches
above, laden with green moss and mold.  Twisted trees and stunted brush
line the edges of the dirt track, creating a winding trail through the
jungle.  The underbrush rattles with the sounds of small animals, and
birds call loudly in the distance.

Bubbling Brook~
A small, clear stream babbles by here peacefully, adding to the comforting
sounds of small animals and birds in the brush and trees around you.  The
path seems to pass over a shallow area in the stream, and crossing is easy.
The water winds it's way to the south, where it cascades over a short drop
to create a majestic sparkling waterfall.

Sharp Turn in Path~
Here the narrow path bends sharply to the north, cutting through the dense
foilage and undergrowth and running around several of the larger trees.
This area of the path, like most of the rest of it, seems to have been
burned out of the surrounding jungle rather than beaten out.

Overgrown Path~
A dead, rotted log has fallen across the path at this point, creating a
minor obstacle.  Insects as large as your hand skitter out from under
the log at your approach.  Multicolored birds flap their way across the
dark green of the canopy above.

Large Clearing~
A welcome respite from the claustrophobic confines of the surrounding
jungle, this large clearing is open to the sky and well lit.  The dense
trees form a barrier, making this place seem like a safe haven for a rest.
Small creatures skitter about in the underbrush and birds flap along the
canopy above.

Thin Trail~
The trail thins out here, creating a narrow passage through the thick
confines of the surrounding jungle.  Many of the short trees that line
this thin trail are heavy with ripening kirgafruit, and rotted fruit and
leaves create a thick, sweet smell of decay.

Split in the Overgrown Trail~
Here the path splits, creating a three-way intersection. To the east,
the trail seems to slope downward slightly and the trees grow together
more densely.  To the north, a thin trail runs nearly straight, ending
at the edge of a crystal-clear lake.

Thin Trail~
This thin trail curves from the east to the northwest, creating a gentle
bend.  Animals rustle the underbrush, creating a vibrant feeling of life
in the jungle.  The air is warm and moist, almost to the point of being
uncomfortably so.

Thin Trail~
To the north along this trail, the jungle seems to become sparser and
less shadowy.  Ancient depressions, shaped like short, broad human
tracks, are sunk lightly in the hard, beaten dirt trail.  The air is
particularly hot and humid in this section of the jungle, causing a
few of the less hardy plants to brown and wilt.

Thinning Trail~
At this point, the jungle begins thinning out a little, becoming less
dense.  In fact, patchy sunlight can now find it's way through the
canopy overhead, providing a more cheerful atmosphere.  The heavy,
sweet scent of jungle flowers permeates this area, making you drowsy.

Thinning Trail~
The trail thins even more here, running to the north and the south.  At
this point, few animals move about and no birds fly overhead.  This is
probably because of the unnaturally warm nature of this area.  Hot
updrafts waft upward, disturbing plants and tree leaves.

visible under the mass of foilage, and rounded stones are scattered randomly
across the path.

End of Path~
The path here peters out and is eaten up by the surrounding greenery.
Nothing can be seen of it, and travel from here gets much more difficult.
Dense underbrush surrounds you in almost every direction, though to the
north it seems sparse enough to pass through.

Thinned Trail~
The trail at this point runs through a much sparser section of jungle,
and the trees seem to be younger here than throughout the rest of the
area.  Water drips in rivulets for the broad leaves of the trees here,
enhancing the moist atmosphere.  Vines twine themselves around some of
the upper branches of the trees, and moss hangs in the places that
recieve sunlight through the sparse canpoy.

Edge of a Ravine~
The trees here end suddenly, mere feet away from the edge of a 200 foot drop.
The edge of a deep ravine drops straight down, as if cut from the earth by a
sword edge.  The obsidian cliff cuts shearly away to the west, while the
jungle encroaches right up to the edge to the east.  Directly across from
your vantage point is a towering volcano, stretching upwards for more than
five thousand feet and dominating the surrounding vista.  Looking down into
the ravine accomplishes nothing, as the shadow from the volcano obscures all
in darkness.

Path Along a Ravine~
The timber runs right up to the edge of a 200-foot drop here, ending at
the cliff's top.  Dense jungle-trees obscure any vista otherwise visible
here, and provide some protection against falling over the cliff-edge.
Birds wing their way across the vivid blue of the sky, providing a
stunning example of the jungle's diversity.

Path Along a Ravine~
This path runs along the edge of a shear cliff, providing a beautiful
vista of the towering volcano.  No plant life seems to grow on the
visible side of the volcano, leaving the interesting rock and ore
patterns visible.  Thus, the volcano seems to be a dazzling array of
colors and textures.  Dark, porous lava rock seem to make up the upper
portion, while hard granite and other rock types provide the volcano's
base.  Thin streamers of smoke reach into the air, emanating from the
peak.

Steep Trail Down a Ravine~
This is the higher end of a downward-sloping trail that plunges into a
dark ravine far below.  To the south and east, the ground rises slightly,
overlooking the ravine from a height of 200 feet.  To the north, the path
drops rapidly, making a steep, but climbable, trail down the cliff-face.

under your feet, cuasing you to slide a little on your way down the steep
trail.

Bottom of Steep Trail~
This is the bottom end of a steep mountain trail.  Stones, rocks, and
boulders of various sizes line the road and are scattered across the
path, making any ascent or descent dangerous.  Twisted trees, heavy with
the frequent rainfalls common to this area, lean far out over the path,
creating some shelter from the warm sun above.

into darkness by the overpowering presence of the volcano.  A chill wind
blows almost continually through here, howling through the rocks and 
crevices.

volcano.  The volcano blankets this small ravine in shadow, making it
dark and cold.  A cool dampness in the ground seems to seep through your
boots, making you shiver.

Steep Trail to Peak~
The ascent here is almost perpendicular, and for many hundreds of feet the
only way up is to pull yourself up a handhold at a time.  Unlike the trees
below, there is no sign of plant or animal life.  All is silent and the air
has become thicker up here, for some reason.

Steep Trail to Peak~
Warm, humid airs assault your nose as you make the hard climb.  Jagged lava
and twisted magma outthrusts from your only handhold, and at times the
climb twists around or over large boulders of a curious gray stone.  It
seems odd that no life lives this high up, not even a simple shrub or
stunted tree.

Nearing the Peak~
The peak is no more than 200 feet above you, on a gently sloping path
to the north.  Small chuncks of broken lava rock slide and skitter down
the path behind you as you ascend this ardorous climb.  The smell of sulfur
is stronger here, for some reason.

Volcano's Peak~
The peak stands thousands of feet above the surrounding jungle.  From this
height, one can see miles in every direction, almost all of which consists
of jungle.  Tree's cover nearly all of the view, except for several large
clearings.  The humid air and obscuring volcano-ash make it impossible to
see much beyond the jungle's perimeter.  The porous lava rock on which you
stand is convulted and jagged, as if it hasn't had the time to be worn down
by wind and water, and the stench of sulfur emenating from the volacano's
crater is noxious.  No greenery peeks forth from the blackish-red rocks that
form the peak, and it is bare until near the base of the volcano.

Crater~
The crater is no more than a hole about 3 feet across, with edges both
jagged and sharp.  It appears that at one time the peak was much lower,
but magma and ash build-up has raised it up to it's present height.  Thus
this hole is now much smaller than it was originally.  Sulfuric vapors pour
forth almost continually from it, obscuring vision and creating an awful
stench.

#4930
Entrance to Clearing~
The thin trail twists past several large trees, and breaks out into a
clearing.  The trees flanking the clearing surround an ancient ruin,
smashed and blasted as if by some divine force.  Burned wood and stone
extend even this far onto the trail, and could make footing dangerous.

Ruins~

The forest floor is littered with stone blocks and ruined timbers, and
the clearing seems to have at one time housed a building of some sort.
Now, however, it is nothing but a blasted ruin.

Pushing Through the Jungle~
Movement is much slower without a clear path to follow.  Low branches and
hanging vines make movement difficult here, and the dense underbrush
catches at your clothing and impedes your progress.  Several of the
surrounding trees seem to almost close in on you, and there are the noises
of large animals not far off in the surrounding jungle.

A 3-foot radius hole is here, displacing the underbrush and creating a
small clearing.  It curves sharply down into the darkness below, but it
gets much larger inside; easily large enough to stand in.  It seems to
lead in a northwesterly direction, about 10 yards below the surface.
Strangely enough, there doesn't seem to be any bird or animal noises in
this part of the jungle.

cylindrical in shape.  It's walls are rough and studded with frequent jagged
outthrusts and stalagtites.  The floor is scuffed and marked with signs
of previous passage, and it has obviously been used recently.  It winds it's
way in a solid northwesterly direction, and it widens and narrows at odd
intervals.

Crystalline Rainbow~
This part of the tunnel is jagged with quartz and rose quartz outcroppings,
all of which reflect and refract the light from your light source, creating
an awe-inspiring color display.  Rainbow hued lights leap and dance in the
air, throwing up a multi-colored curtain of blinding light.  Squinting against
the beautiful display, you see that the only exits are to the south and to
the northwest.

Hot Spring~
A branch of some brook or jungle stream pours down from above, cascading
into small pools, which drain ever so slowly through cracks and breaks
in the stone floor.  The most notable feature about the pools, however, is
that they are steaming comfortably.  Probably heated by magma before plunging
through this room, the water makes this room a natural sauna.  The walls
glisten with slickness as the steam condenses on the cool stone.

Shattered Crystals~
This room must have once housed some strange and beautiful crystal formations,
but something, or someone, has broken and shattered them, creating razor sharp
fragment of broken crystal that covers the floor.  Walking here would be
dangerous, and running quite impossible.  Strange light patterns and shadows
form on the wall as your light refracts through each of the shattered pieces.

Upward Slope~
The tunnel narrows slightly here and begins to slope upwards.  Although not
very steep, the grade is littered with small pebbles and broken gravel,
making the climb a little more interesting.  The tunnel stretches to the
east, while a gentle bend is visible to the northwest.

Underground Stairs~
A broken rock strata here forms a crude natural stairway, leading upwards
into the dark caverns above.  Strange dripping and bubbling sounds can be
heard at intervals, amplified by the tunnel's stone walls.  The stone of
the stairway seems scuffed and chipped.  Apparently you are not the first

A Split in a Stone Passageway~
A crude natural staircase tops out here, at a split in this stone passage.
One branch winds it's narrow way north, while the other juts straight east
into darkness.  The air here is musty and stale, and the taste of dust is

Worn Passageway~
The passageway here has been worn down by natural erosion, creating smooth

years of natural polish have brought out strange and wonderous colors and
patterns in the stone here, creating interesting shadows on the walls.

Stone Passage~
This passage seems to have been cut from the stone by human hand and chisel,

magma that forms a huge pool at the bottom of this cavern.  It's red glow
illuminates the whole cavern in an eerie red light.  Hot air currents drift
upward from the pool, creating a hot breeze.  The air here is hard to breathe
and the heat is almost unbearable.  An intense sulfur smell assaults your nose
and makes breathing unpleasant, as well.  A thin, unrailed span of stone
stretches across the pool.

smoke obscures the ceiling and darkens the walls with greasy soot.
A floor of wooden planks covers the bare stone beneath your feet,
though it is burned and rotted through in many places.  The stench
of sulfur, combined with the stink of the heavy smoke, makes breathing

stone throne, with wooden arms and a padded seat, rests again the wall.
Torches line the walls here with greater frequency than the rest of the

condition here, being relatively free from holes and rotted wood.

The span is a narrow jutting of stone, no more that 5 feet thick and 3
across.  A drop of over 200 feet into a pool of molten magma awaits
to both sides of you, and the hot updrafts from below make balancing
precarious, at best.  The main problem with the span, however, is the fact
that a good portion of it is missing up ahead!  Apparently, it broke under
it's own weight and plunged into the magma-pool below.

upper branches.  Many animal tracks lead through here, most heading to or from
the placid pool at the northern end of the clearing.

green sea of treetops and tropical foilage stretches to the edge of your
vision, broken only by thin lines indicating trails and the towering
expanse of black stone that forms the volcano, in the near distance to the
northwest.  Closer at hand and to the north is a truly magnificent sight: a
great river plunges over high ledge, forming a sparkling wall of diamonds.
The crystal pool of clear water that it forms snakes outwards into several
smaller brooks and streams.  Touching off this breathtaking vista are the
many-colored birds of paradise and the bright macaws which soar above the
jungle's canopy.  Their comforting noises and the breath of warm wind make
this place truly a thing to remember.
