The Trials Begin~
This is the start of the trials. A long dark hallway
stands before you. Strange sounds filter in from the north.
The walls here are bare stone, carved with pulsing red
runes. Prepare yourself for the Trials are unforgiving at best.
You may enter the trials to the north, or return to the southeast

The 1st Trial~
As you enter the first room, the door behind you slams
shut. A tall figure stands before you wearing the armorments
of a warrior. Red slits stare out at you from a blackend helmet.
The walls here are the same blackend stone with red runes 
writhing on them. Skeletons of the past challengers lie strewn
about the floor. Death hangs in the air. The only way out now
is through the dark warrior before you.

The 2nd Trial~
The first trial fades to a bad memory as you enter this
room. Another warrior stands before you. Almost identical to
the first. The only obvious difference is the silver band on
the right arm. Sounds of combat drift in from the north, as the
warrior steps forward. The runes here glow a brighter red as 
you ready yourself. To continue you must defeat this warrior.

The 3rd Trial~
The third trial is upon you. A shadowy figure skulks in a 
corner. Twin blades flash as you enter the room. Blackness is
all around you. There are runes here also but they are dim.
The floor is covered in dried blood and decaying bodys.
The 4th trial awaits you to the north.

The 4th Trial~
You have entered the 4th trial. A man in dark robes stands
before you. Power drips from his wizend frame. Waving his 
arms mystical forces build around him. Far to the north a
chuckling may be heard as the mage gathers the mighty powers.
Stepping foward he waves you on. The door to the north awaits.

The 5th Trial~
You have made it half-way through the beginners trials. 
A gaunt figure stands before you. Pale skin drawn tight to
a face that seems ageless. Pale white lips curl back in a
mockery of a smile, to reveal terrable fangs. The vampier
daggers whisper a song of death as they are drawn out. The
rooms only exit is north

The 6th Trial~
This is the sixth trial. A man wearing the robes of a Cleric
is here. Glowing with divine power. The room is brightly lit by
glowing white balls. The floor and walls are white with red 
runes carved into them. The air crackles with a unworldly 
pressense. The hall continues to the north.

The 7th Trial~
This room is different then the others. It is a woodland setting.
Bright sun shines down on you from a pale blue sky. Birds and 
crickets chirp in the air around you. Large grey trunked trees
surround you. A man emerges from the tree line, shrouded in mystical
flames. He strides toward you with a stern look on his face. His
brown robes flowing in the light breeze, he draws twin scimtars.

The 8th Trial~
This trial takes place in a study. The room is odd, there are books
and scrolls lining the dark walls, but also there is a training area
for combat. A man stands here practicing slashes and parrys on a
magicly animated target. In one hand he holds a long sword while the
other glows with a magical aura. He turns as you enter, and smiles.

The 9th Trial~
This room is also a woodland setting. A cabin stands before you.
In the yard of the cabin a man stands chopping wood. Tall and
muscular he splits the wood with one stroke. Clothes of green and
brown blend him perfectly to the forest around him. A deer carcass
is hanging in a nearby tree the skin drying on a frame. The man
looks up, puts down the wood axe and draws a mighty two handed sword
from a sheath lying next to him.

The 10th Trial~
This is the final begginers trial. A tall gate stands before you
leading to the advanced trials. There is a creature standing guard 
over the gate. A monsterous creature with scaly skin and blazing red eyes.
It snarls as you enter. This demon is here to sway those who would
continue from going on. To get to the Advanced trials this creature
must fall.

Flux's Donation~
This larg room has been set aside for donations to the sect.
Here you may leave items for your fellow sect members in need.
Walls of grey stone glisten slightly. The White tiled floor
is spotless. A large statue of Laric stands in the back of the
room, with a wry smile on its face. The sounds of murmuring may
be heard from the east.

Flux's Portals~
Many portals fill this room. Some fade in and out while others
are very stable. Sounds drift in from each of them causing the 
room to have the sound and feel of a Bazzar. Exits lead in all
directions. Some may leave others mat lead back to where you 
stand. Hopfuly you will choose the right one.

The Pool of Flux~
A large pool fills the room. Glowing white shot with many
hues. Ever moving ever changing, images fill the pool. 
Past, present, and future mix and swirl. Voices of those long
gone echo through the room. The walls are made of a scintilating
rainbow colored substance that emits a pleasant sound.
The floor has many nooks and platforms, seemingly to rest on
Warmth and comfort radiate throughout the room.
