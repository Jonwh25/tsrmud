Northern end of the Temple~
Around you are many monks chanting and praying. Tall wooden pillars
disappear in the haze above you. The constant and monotonous tapping of 
a some wooden object rattles your brain and seems to be almost hypnotizing.
The temple is filled with incense smoke and the resonant sounds of many
monks chanting. The chanting seems to almost have a life of its own as it
can be felt even through the hard granite below you. There are red candles
and incense burners along the wall and on small pedestals around the room.
