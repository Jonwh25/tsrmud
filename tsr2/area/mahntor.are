The dark woods~
You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
A small sign is posted here.

The dark woods~
You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
The path winds north and south into darkness.

The small intersection in the forest~
The forest path splits here in three directions. Small paths lead to the east,
north, and south. The trees above leave a gap which allows light to fill the
intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
Something has been scrawled in the dirt in blood here.

The edge of the forest and hills~
You stand at the edge of a dark forest. A path leads north into the forest and
its deadly darkness and silence. Looking west, you see a path that leads up
into a foothills region. Standing here on the boundary between light and
darkness, you feel very vulnerable and alone.

In the dense forest~
You walk along a small path leading through a dark forest. No sounds can be
heard and little light penetrates the canopy of trees above you. The air here
smells musty and you long for a fresh breath. You see an intersection of paths
to the west. The path you are on leads south into the darkening woods.

The dark forest path~

wet quagmire. It is difficult to walk, and you make squishing sounds as you
move on. Looking east, you see a swampy path. The main path leads north and
south into darkness.

The bloody intersection~
This is a small intersection. Paths lead east, west, and south. You are struck
by the carnage here when you enter the clearing. There appears to have been a
great battle here. Blood is everywhere and the ground is all torn up. Pieces
of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here
lead you to believe that the dead and wounded were dragged off in two 
directions, south and east.

cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

cave as a home. Skeletal remains lie all over. Several half-eaten corpses are
rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a
large pile of rotting cloth, fur, and plant matter. Light and safety is
towards the west.

notice signs of life in the rocky crags here. You can climb down towards the
shore or head north into the hills themselves. The rocky summit you are
