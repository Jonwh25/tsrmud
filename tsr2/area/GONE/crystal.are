Goldmoon girl~
Goldmoon~
Goldmoon is singing a beautiful song here.
~
The girl's eyes are a bright sky blue; her skin is a buttery tan. Most striking
of all is the flowing white gold of her hair. Plush white furs trim her woven
cape. A single feather folds back along the right side of her head.

Rock Outcropping~
From this rock outcropping the valley below seems peaceful, untouched.
Dense forests of pine carpet the mountainsides, broken only by thick aspen 
woods. The mountains, deep blue in the distance, circle the valley floor and

There is a sign nailed to a nearby tree.

Twin Flat~
A clear mountain valley sprawls about. To the northwest and southeast,
thick vallenwoods flash yellow and scarlet against the bright autumn sky.
To the east shimmers the cool blue of the Crystalmir Lake. Westward, the
valley enters a canyon rimmed by granite cliffs. The valley floor itself
continues to the northeast.
Some distance away, a group of huddled men pulls a large cart slowly
west down the Haven road. They sway rhythmically. Coarse, heavy robes
completely conceal their features.

Stone bridge~
The Solace Stream sparkles beneath an ancient stone bridge. Water tumbles
out of the forest, over the rocks, and toward the Southpass that lies between
southern Sentinel Peaks. West of the bridge, the road splits in two, branching
to the south and the west. Both roads wind among the great vallenwoods,
whose boughs form a brilliant canopy over the roadway.

It is very dim here. You can make out the faint surfaces of the lake floor
and other rocks. You hope you can hold your breath long enough.
It looks as if the surface of the lake is make of glass...
In fact you can't break the surface!...You need air SOON!
