choker vine~
A Choker Vine~
A long stretch of underwater vine weaves in you direction.
~
Before you is a  virutal nest of vines, leaves, and thorns.  Obviously a mindless predator, the choker vine reaches for you with undisguised hunger.  Tnagled in its reach are skeletons of those not fortunate to recognize the
 murderous nature of this seemingly innocent plant.

A member of a pride of Sea Lions.~
A sea-lion swims with its packmates.

for any opponent.

Electric Eel~
The Electric Eel~
The eel watches its prey with a gaze that is almost electric.
~
With little more than the first few feet of it's body visible the eel snatches
and bites at anything that ventures near its home in the reef.  A dull 
mottled green in color, it's mouth displays many small yet very sharp teeth.
Small darts of electricity jump from the eel to it's intended prey, alerting
you to the special nature of this beast.

reef Giant~
The Reef Giant~
Ready to defend his home, the Reef Giant watches you warily.
~
Towering above you is a giant of a man.  He has burnished coppery skin and
pale white hair.  Powerfully muscled and barrel chested, he appears to 
be a formidible foe.  He wears nothing but loincloth, and bracers, and appears
unimpeded by the pressure of the water.

Shark~
A great white Shark.~
Like a silent angel of death, the great white shark lunges.
~
Sliding through the water like an angel of death, the shark is upon you 
before you are even certain it is there.  With row upon row of razor sharp
teeth this is a foe to be wary of.  Smelling fresh meat in the water it 
advances, with a flick of its great tail, it is upon you.

red fish Dragonfish~
A Red Dragonfish.~
A great red Dragonfish is waiting for its' next meal to be delivered.
~
Swimming lazily through the water, the Dragonfish is approximatly three
feet in length and covered with inch long tines and reddish-maroon scales.
The tines seem to be secreting a dark green ichor that is creating a 
cloud around the fish.  A few of them seem to have broken off, obviously 
lodged in some hapless beast.

Caught in the Maelstrom~
The moment you enter the Maelstrom, you are sucked into its very core. 
You spin in every direction pulled by the force of the water.  You see the
floor of the ocean rushing up to meet you, only to find yourself suddenly
yanked back as though grabbed by the sea itself.  Direction has become
impossible to determine, and there does not seem to be an up, nor a down.

Beneath the Waves~
You have been thrown clear of the Malestrom, swirling end over end you
finally manage to right yourself, and discover yourself not far from where
you began this journey.  Just enough like filters through the waves to give
everything a shadowed look, to your south the Maelstrom rages attempting to
pull you to a watery grave.  Schools of fish swim nearby as to larger
predators, after all victims of the great whirlpool often provide an easy
meal.

Beneath the Waves~
The water here is dark and cool, to the south the maelstrom continues to rage
To the east you see what seems to be the beginnings of an intricate coral reef,
while directly beneath you, you see the remains of a ship that must have run
aground on thos same reefs.  Small fish circle the wreck picking and biting
at the flesh of long dead sailors.

Coral Reef~
This reef has been carved and worked into an intricate dwelling.  Lifetimes
of work have been spent creating a mansion out of a coral reef.  Looking 
inside you see that it is stocked with furniture and personal belongings,
all of them are crafted for a person well over sixteen feet in height.
The reef itself is alive with plants and coral.  Small fish are everywhere,
as are small crustaceans.

On the Reef~
The water is shallow here, due to the reef that stretches out beneath
you.  You must pick your way cautiously here, as the coral is sharp. 
Seaweed waves lazily in the current caused by the great whirlpool to the
west.  Small fish and other assorted sealife dart in and out of the small
caves and crevices in the reef.

In the Sea~
Here the reef drops away sharply, falling into the blackness beneath you.
> The water has become colder and darker.  Larger shapes move in the deeper
waters appearing to be nothing more than monstrous shadows.  The maelstrom
continues its eternal struggle to your left, and the waters become shallow
to the north where the reef becomes more pronounced.

In the Sea~
This area of the sea seems to be devoid of all life.  There are no fish,
no clams, barely even any seaweed.  Beneath You you spy what seems to be a
small cave hewn into the rock.  Littered about the entrance are bones.  You
identify what appears to be humanoid bones, fish bones and even the
occasional Shark bone.  Whatever calls the cave home is probabaly something
you do not want to mess with.  A strong current attempts to pull you to the
northwest, directly into the raging heart of the maelstrom.

Seaweed Patch~
The light from the sun does not penetrate here.  The entire area seems to
be crowded with plants and seaweed that hover a few feet below the surface. 
The plants range in color from a mottled green to a rusty brown.  Though
they sway in the current from the maelstrom to the east, they also seem to
be moving purposely in an entirely different direction.

The azure depths shimmer with the light of the surface, sending shafts of
sun into the darkness below.  Seaweed waves lazily in the current caused by
the great whirlpool to the north.  Small fish and other assorted sealife
dart about chasing one another and avoiding the larger predators which are
in abundance.  You seem to have impeded on the hunting grounds of a rather
territorial bunch of predators.

The light filtering through the waves above sheds just enought light for
you to see the corals around you.  These waters would be considered
beautiful, were it not for there deadly reputation.  To your south the
Maelstrom rages you catch glimpses of others who were not lucky enough to
escape it.  A dead sailor slides past, glassy eyes staring eternally
outwards, and small bubbles leaking from his mouth.  You catch glimpses of
white bone on the sea floor below, it is obvious that the great whirlpool has
claimed many a life.
