A xaren blends into the surrounding rock making it very hard to see
~
The xaren is a relative of the xorn.  The creature before you has three legs
and three appendages which serve as arms.  Each of the appendages has
three large claws on them.  On the top of the creature, where the head
should be is a huge gaping mouth.  On both sides of the appendage facing
you are two large eyes.  The skin of this creature looks just like rock and
thus it seems to fade into the background.

The cloaker~
A cloak rises off the floor and stares at you with two glowing eyes
~
This is a cloaker, a shadow-dwelling, unearthly creature.  A cloaker
resembles a large semicircular cloak or blanket with two claw-like
appendages at the tips and a long, mace-like tail.  Black eyespots cover its
back like buttons on a cloak, and when the tail is hidden it is almost
impossible to distinguish from a real cloak.  In the middle of the front is a
large gaping mouth and two glowing eyespots.

members and orchestrate them as a single entity.  The large table has
enough room for about twenty people, and at the head sits the master thief.

and a cooking device and the third room is the washroom.  Not a very
interesting place.

The way back to the city is to the south
