lord mardagon zombie master~
the Zombie Master~
Lord Mardagon, the Zombie master glares about and mumbles incoherently.
~
This eccentric individual seems to look right through you as he mumbles
gibberish to himself.  He seems as mindless as the zombies that are under
his power.  However, his white hair, and bright eyes, belie any ideas of
senility.  This man is as dangerous as any creature you have encountered.

Gatekeeper~
the Gatekeeper~
The Gatekeeper to Bell's Toll guards against intruders.
~
He is garbed in a long black shroud disguising any features from view. 
As he towers over you, you realize he will play no favorites with those that
cross him.  The Gatekeeper gazes over your head to the silent forest around
you.

vampire~
a vampire~
A vampire lurks about looking hungry.
~
This pale creature is well-dressed in a dark suit remeniscent of the 18th
century.  Against the black of the jacket, the skin appears very pale and
sickly.  The tiny points on this individual's eyeteeth, and the hunger in
it's eyes as it looks at you, alert you to it's nature.

corpse zombie~
a zombie~
A walking corpse dressed in tattered clothing drools on itself here.
~
This creature, when alive, once was a magnificent specimen of a human. 
Raised from the dead by the macabre science of Lord Mardagon, the zombie
master, the individual standing before you is a miracle (or freak) of
nature.  The zombie is dressed in the tattered remains of its clothing, and
the stench emanating from them is almost unbearable.  With disjointed
mumbling, and copious drooling, it seems that the intellectual capabilities
of the individual were not regenerated along with the body.

giant zombie~
the zombie giant~
The largest zombie in the world grumbles angrily here.
~
This creature was perhaps Lord Mardagon's biggest mistake.  A giant's
temperment does not lend itself to being experimented on.  Angry in life,
this gigantic eyesore has become angrier still in death.  It would be best
to avoid this particular zombie at all costs.

It seems that the experiments of the zombie master extended as far as the
family pet.  The collar about this dogs throat reads 'G'nor'.  It looks
fierce and wild in death where it was once gentle and loyal in life.

clutching the hilt of a black sword in his talons, and a red rose in his
beak.

with a crooked finger.

slippers look brand new; probably made solely for this occasion.

the Statue of Dracul~
A statue as black as death stands here.
~
This silent figure is frozen in a nonchalant pose, hands clasped behind
his back.  He is wearing a long black cloak which appears to have been
frozen while flapping in a strong wind.  His face is intricately carved,
showing high cheekbones, a hooked nose, and piercing eyes.  His mouth is
curved into a sardonic grin revealing wickedly pointed fangs.

pure white marble depicts the ice queen in all her glory.  The diaphanous
gown she wears billows to her feet, and her arms are outstretched in

Visible are a smooth alabaster cheek, and a delicately arched brow.

This painting has captured Belana in a rare moment of happiness.  Her
long golden tresses shimmer in the candlelight, and her eyes twinkle as she
gifts the artist with a bright smile.  As befits her reputation as the Ice
Queen, Belana is garbed in white and silver, complete with a delicate silver
coronet taming her unruly hair.  To be in possession of such a portrait is a
mark of favour granted to only her closest friends.

Gateway to Bell's Toll~
Before you towers an arching gateway.  The pillars seem to be composed of
bone and the arch above the gates is lined with ancient skulls.  The eerie
stillness of the forest pervades here, yet you have the feeling of being
watched.  A sudden gust of wind from the west brings the stench of death,
and to your east, the turrets of Castle Bloodbane rise to the sky.  Above
the grinning skulls is a rotted wooden sign, proclaiming this the entrance
to Bell's Toll.  You can enter Bell's Toll to the north, or leave this place
to the south.

Inside the Gateway~
Inside the gates the sky seems to darken and your footsteps become muted.
Bell's Toll is a place of great evil, and this is characterized by the black
stone at your feet and the dark grove of trees blocking your path to the
north.  No light penetrates the leafless forest that seems to serve as a
border between the castle proper to the east, and the extensive graveyard to
the west.

The path at your feet appears to be composed of a dark stone which

west towards the cemetary.  The forest blocking your way to the north forms a
macabre tableaux lacking only the proper illumination.  The path continues

You follow the path marked by the black stone at your feet.  To your left

this were some boundary into a world of evil.  The sky to your east lightens
as if to form a beacon to safety.

A wooden gate swings lazily on ancient hinges as you approach.  The road
here becomes a trail marked in dirt and as your eyes become accustomed to
the darkness, you notice a nearly invisible wooden fence demarking the
cemetary boundaries.  A sign mounted on a wooden post warns travellers that
this area and all it's inhabitants are under the protection of Lord
Mardagon, the zombie master.  You can enter the cemetary grounds to the

These seem to be the sites of future interrments.  Several have already been
staked out and marked for recent arrivals.  A few plots have already had the
graves dug, and the dirt is piled beside the holes, waiting for the imminant

from overrunning the well-kept cemetary.

A freshly dug grave~
The trail ends here at an open grave.  The earth around the grave looks
very fresh, as if it had been dug just before you arrived.  The smell of
newly turned over rotten earth assails your sense of smell.  There are no
mourners in sight, and no footsteps, save your own, mark the trail to or

threatens to push you closer to the edge.

deteriorated badly with time.  There is no door, merely an opening into which
light does not penetrate.  The building itself appears as if it will

Entrance to a Crypt~
Adjusting to the darkness, you notice the stone enclosure surrounding
you.  Cracks and fissures have been worn into the rock face over time,
contributing to the decrepit appearance of this tomb.  Remnants of statues
and intricate carvings identify this crypt as belonging to a personage of
some importance.  You make out a crest carved above the doorway to your
north.  It depicts a single rose twined about the blade of a dark sword. 
Beneath the image are carved the words "Nothing is trivial."

water drips and flows causing the extreme dankness of the passage.  This

Entombed Nobleman~
You are standing before a large stone sarcophagus.  Into the immense
stone lid is carved an intricate crest.  Upon closer examination, you notice
the crest is the same sword and rose design as the crest above the entrance
to this crypt.  The walls, though they have deteriorated over time, still
show remmnants of rich tapestries, and brightly coloured fabrics draped here
and there.  The obvious wealth of the room indicates this tomb as being that
of an ancient nobleman.  Perhaps this person once lived and ruled from
Castle Bloodbane, the seat of power for Queen Kavmora.  Your torchlight
flickers in the musty air as you survey your surroundings.  At your feet,
rats slink about on missions unfathomable to a human eye.

trapped here and tried to escpe.  To your immediate east, the dirt wall

Piles of bones, armor, and assorted weapons litter the floor of this

Obviously great battles have been won and lost in this little chamber.  The
walls, floor, and ceiling are constructed of stone, causing your footsteps
to echo wildly in such an enclosed space.  In fact, your head barely clears
the ceiling.  Many a traveller has visited this lair, and most have never
returned.  Will you show enough courage?

Beneath the Tomb~
You are standing in a large stone cavern, lit by flickering torches. 
Scenes depicting great battles are painted in huge murals on the walls.  The
western wall shows a scene from the Battle of R'gnoth, the great ancient
conflict between the mages of Hark'oth, and the legions of undead commanded
by Lord Mardagon's grandsire, Tenchk Kinstealer.  The northern and southern
walls are depictions of the opposing armies from the Truthseeker Wars. 
These wars began and ended the quest to find and rid the earth of Nosferatu.
The east wall, marred by a gaping crack, remains blank, as if awaiting
future conflicts to glorify.

passing near your head.  Underfoot, you hear and feel dozens of insects as
you trample them by your passage.  The faint glow from the west and the

flesh.  The only exit is to the north.

An Unmarked Grave~
The trail you follow passes by a large mound of earth.  It resembles a
fresh grave, yet it remains unmarked; no tombstone, not even a simple cross
stands to name the poor soul who lies buried here.  A small bunch of daisies
lay here as an offering, perhaps as an attempt to apologize for the
unaffordable luxury of a tombstone.  The trail continues past here both east
and north.

silence of the area.  Even the trees seem to be keeping the reverent
silence, with still, serene branches.  Even the slight breeze does not
disturb the leaves.  Your tread light and your heart heavy, you examine your
surroundings.  To the east you notice an ancient tombstone, cracked and worn
by the elements over time.  It's inscription reads 'Beloved in life; mourned
by his passing T'worf Lhendor, BlackRavenHunter lies here, in peace at last.
The grave to your west is marked with a slightly newer stone.  It reads
'Brave, Loyal, Beautiful.  Keth of the House Lhendor: Her family mourns the
loss of this proud member.  ' The stone is intricately carved with a bold
black eagle soaring to the heavens.  The path through the graves continues

Hassan, and is as awe-inspiring.  Perhaps the family of the deceased wanted
protection from grave-robbers.  A small brass plaque at the base of the
statue states that this is the resting place of Kavmora of the House of
Lhendor.  The path winds it's way through the graves north and south from

is the Pauper's Pit, the communal grave for those who are unable to afford
the price of a plot in this cemetary.  Several shovels and spades have been
abandonned at the edge of the pit, and you notice that many of the bodies
have been tampered with.  Limbs are missing, and the remains of the corpses
are strewn about.  Obviously this is Lord Mardagon's source of bodies for
his experiments.  The path leads you north and south past this horrible

with an unnatural light.  You can continue through this forest to the east,

As you follow the black stone path at your feet, the castle looms larger
in your vision.  With its towering turrets and large courtyards surrounded
by many feet of stone walls, it seems a formidable fortress.  The silent
forest to your north blocks your passage in that direction, and it seems to
be standing at attention; in awe of the presence of Castle Bloodbane.  The
path continues east towards the castle, or west to the entrance to Bell's
Toll.

West Bank~
This is the western bank of the moat surrounding Castle Bloodbane.  The
moat is approximately ten feet wide, and is murky enough to obscure the
bottom of the channel.  You can, however, make out slight ripples and swirls
as something moves beneath the surface.  You may cross the moat by way of a
narrow wooden bridge to your east.

East Bank ~
You stand on the eastern bank of the murky moat.  To your north you are
dwarfed by the immense stone archway marking the entrance to Castle
Bloodbane.  High above, guardsmen keep constant vigil, warning visitors to
this keep of the protective surveilance.  A single banner adorns the entry;
the banner of Queen Kavmora.  On a golden background, the crest shows a
majestic black eagle soaring to the heavens, clutching the hilt of a black
sword in its talons, and a single red rose in its beak.  You may enter the
castle to the north, or cross the moat to the west.

Castle Entrance~
As you enter the castle, you are immediately struck by the distinct lack
of natural light.  Torches line the walls, providing a bright orange aura
around all the objects in the hall.  The grey stone walls are bleak and
bare, devoid of any covering.  Any dust of sound seems to echo off the bare
walls and return amplified tenfold.  Unseen eyes track your presence here,
silently guarding against threat.

Guardroom~
In the centre of this stone room sits a long wooden table.  Chairs and
rubbish are strewn about, and you see the remnants of the previous night's
meal still on the table.  Considering the overpowering stench, and the
maggot-infested food left around, this keep's guards are not the most
hygenic, nor the most disciplined.

Grand Hall~
Your steps echo loudly as you walk into the centre of the courtyard. 
Looking upwards, you are impressed by the height of the vaulted ceiling as
it soars upwards.  Overlooking the courtyard are two floors, with arched
openings in the stone.  There is a distinct lack of natural light in this
enclosure, yet the whole building seems to glow with an unseen light source.
Leading to the first floor is an immense white marble stairway polished to a
high sheen.  Banners are draped from the first floor arches, creating an air
of majesty and honour befitting the inhabitants of this castle.

The Gallery~
You pass through a narrow hall adjacent to the open courtyard to your

dark oil colours.  The image is of a regal elderly woman with silver hair
shining by candlelight.  She sits straight-backed on a golden throne, with a
black wolfhound by her side.  As you pass this picture, the eyes seem to
follow you in an eerie silence.

You pass through a narrow hall adjacent to the open courtyard to your

golden frame.  The picture depicts a raven-haired beauty standing at an open
window.  Her face is half-turned to gaze at the green scenery outside.  You
can, however make out a flawless, pale complexion, and deep green eyes. 
This image of serene beauty is marred only by a gaping slash down the centre
of the painting, as if some thwarted lover exacted a brutal revenge in the
name of love.

You pass through a narrow hall adjacent to the open courtyard to your

on their wedding day.  The bride, swathed in white , gazes out at you with
eyes as blue as the oceans, and the groom looks severe in his black jacket
and cloak.  This pale young man has neatly groomed blond hair, and his
arresting grey eyes seem to follow your movements down the hall.  The artist
has scrawled the names of his subjects in the bottom left corner of the
painting: Selan and Laia.  Beside their names is painted a tiny black eagle.

You pass through a narrow hall adjacent to the open courtyard to your

silhouette.  On your left is an oval frame containing a painting of a tiny
red-haired woman.  Her red mouth is turned up in a mischevious smile, and
her deep green eye is crinkled in amusement.  She has a sprinkle of freckles
across the bridge of her nose.  The portrait to your right is of a handsome
young man.  His powerful features, and dark beauty are overshadowed by the
bright smile on his face.  Both pictures seem to give off an aura of magic
that is hard to ignore.  You find it difficult to tear your gaze from these
two portraits.

small nook, partially enclosed by deep maroon drapes.  Peeking inside, you
see a single torch on the wall, and a small wooden bench.  This area is
obviously meant for weary strollers to rest, and is likely used for romantic
assignations.  In the far corner, you notice a small black grate built into
the wall.  Despite the rusted appearance of the grate, it seems to have been

stand circular tables carved of oak.  Here, the guests of the Queen lay down
their weapons, prior to enjoying the hospitality of their host.

open for ease of passage as the servants bustle to and fro, placating the

The heat of the castle's kitchen is almost unbearable.  Two large
fireplaces lit with roaring fires stand at either end of this long room. 
Several stations for preparing food are arranged for best possible mobility.
Dried herbs, baskets, and curing meat hang from hooks on the ceiling, and
sacks of assorted spices line the floor.  Stepping through the litter of
garbage, you can continue through the hot kitchen to your south.

Here, the kitchen becomes something more of a butcher's shop, with sides
of beef hanging from ceiling hooks, and a large chopping block set in the
centre of the room.  Oddly enough, most of the bones strewn about do not
appear to be animal in nature.  Dozens of stoppered flasks neatly line
shelves along the eastern wall.  You notice the small door to the larder to
your south.

The Larder~
You stand in a rather damp and chilly room filled to overflowing with
jars and bottles tightly stoppered, and neatly lined on shelves and along
the walls on the floor.  Opening one jar, you are immediately overcome by
the strong tangy smell of stale blood.  Horrified, you realize that all
these containers are filled with blood.  The remaining question is whether
this blood is of animal nature, or perhaps...  Human?

Dungeon Guardroom~
Before you is a rickety wooden table, with a chess game in progress set
upon it.  Straw and rubbish are strewn about the cold dirt floor, and only
one torch lights the small dank room.  To your east are two cells meant for
prisoners.  Separating the cells from this room is a narrow, barred door. 
This door is covering in rust and mildew from the dampness of the air.  It
stands ajar, with the keys still in the keyhole.  The guards are obviously
not concerned with possible escape attempts.

Prisoner's Cell~
Opening the rusty, squeaky door, you find yourself in what closely
resembles a hole in the ground.  In fact, many of the piles of dirt have not
been removed from the cell.  No light at all reaches this room, and the only
source of light is that from your own torch.  Looking around the small cell,
you see groups of nearly naked individuals huddled together for warmth, or
perhaps fear.  They do not seem to notice you, and their blank eyes gaze
forward uncaring.  Strange marks mar their bodies; marks that appear as two
small punctures, usually located near the major arteries.  The only exit
from this cell is the one you entered through, yet the prisoners show no
sign of wanting to leave.

marble.  This silent figure is shown garbed in a long black cloak frozen
while flapping in the wind.  The face above the cloak is intricately carved,
showing high cheekbones, a curved nose, and piercing eyes.  His mouth is
curved in a sardonic grin, revealing wicked fangs.  Carved in the base of
the statue is a name; Dracul Demonkiller.

crib is fashioned from a single block of black granite, and is decorated
with plush red bedclothes.  A haunting lullaby plays softly in the
background as you stand uneasily on the threshhold.

small arrowslits in the stone walls.  These are covered during the daylight
hours by small flaps of wood.

Catwalk~
You stand on a narrow wooden plank floor, surrounded by stone walls.  You
see small wooden flaps covering arrowslits in the wall at about eye level. 
The floor creaks as you pass through this confining enclosure, and dust rises
from the fall of your foot on the planks.  This is the way the castle guards
travel to and from their towers to keep watch.

Ballroom~
Your steps echo as you walk across the highly polished marble floor.  The
high, vaulted ceiling is painted to resemble the sky; blue with billowing
white clouds.  A large sun-shaped golden crest hangs on the wall directly in
front of you.  Beneath the crest are set many chairs as well as misic
stands, ready for the orchestra to strike up a waltz.  There are numerous
torches lining the walls.  They are all lit as if awaiting a grand ball. 
Chairs are lined up around the periphary of the room for potential
wallflowers.  To the east you see large french doors leading to the balcony,
and the west doors lead back to the hallway of the castle.

Balcony~
Entering the balcony, you find that it is not really a balcony at all. 
Instead, this room, is an enclosed niche, with the far wall painted in an
elaborate mural.  This mural depicts a peaceful summer day; sun shining,
blue sky, and green landscape.  Large pots filled with flowers line the
walls.  The scent of the blooms, and the colour leave you with a peaceful,
serene feeling.  Ballgoers can step in here for some quiet during the rowdy
party.

Throne Room~
As you enter this room, you are amazed at the opulent splendor
surrounding you.  Rich tapestries depicting scenes from various bloody
battles adorn the walls.  The carpet underfoot is soft, and the scent of
wild roses gently wraps itself around you.  The plethora of antiques
littering the room convinces you to tread carefully to avoid breaking
something priceless.  In front of you stands a large throne cast in silver
and gold.  The silence filling the room is overwhelming, even your breathing
disturbs the awe-filled quiet of the room.  You may exit this room to the
west, or enter the Queen's Parlour to the east.

Queen's Parlour~
Entering the Queen's private sanctuary, you pause in the doorway to let
your eyes adjust to the dim lighting.  A single candle set upon a side table
provides illumination for an intimate dinner for two.  Golden tankards,
trenchers of half eaten food and elegant silverware adorn the table.  A
bouquet of scentless black roses serves as the centrepiece for this meal.  A
hastily scrawled note lies at your feet.  It reads : "Dearest, Time grows
short.  Be Ready.  Yours, Ruark Mardagon".
