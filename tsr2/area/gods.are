The Admin Bar & Grill.~
You stand in a cozy room built for the Admins of this world. All the
Ancient gods come here to chat of old times and laugh about foolish
mortals who died at their hands. You see pictures on a dart board
of Elias, Cerebus, Milamber, and a few others too ugly to place
a picture of here. The Gods take great pleasure in throwing darts
and spells at those pictures.

creators like to rest.

In Memory of Baldr~
You find yourself walking the sea shore at sunset.  Soft, soothing mist curls
contentedly around your ankles.  A cool salt breeze lifts your hair and
pastes tendrils of hair to your cheeks.  The sounds of the water pound and
roar in your ears.  Waves rise up and break in front of you, their foam gently
tugging at you, tempting you, begging you to walk out into their depths.
Someone has written in the sand the words, "We love you Baldr" and placed
delicate blue and green sea shells all around.

Dreamerie~
The sensation you feel upon entering this room is wholly ethereal. Each step
you take provides you with a soft 'sussssss' sound. Sepha's room is changeable.
One moment, you'll see a bedroom, and be able to sit upon the soft furs there,
the next moment, you are in a ballroom. The hazy edges around everything there
gives truth to the dream. It makes you feel this is, indeed, merely a dream.
One one wall, though, despite what the rest of the room looks like, is a large
bookshelf. Most of the pages of these books are empty. Some are not. A table
and chair sits by this bookshelf, though the style of it alters as the room
does.

Beowolf's Chamber of Chaos.~
You stand in a amazingly huge room. A large crystal chandiller hangs
from the arched ceiling like a silent watcher on a hill. Rows of huge
metalic torches line the walls burning with a purple hue. To the back
of the room is a large oak desk. On the desk is a huge pile of scrolls
and parchments. The floor of the room is adorned with crimson colored
carpet. All around you is fine luxury.

Hell.~
Now, you've done it... the gods must have truly forsaken you, to have sent
you straight to hell!! It is highly advised to wait here to make your
appeal to the wrath of the gods,,, or face being damned to hell
for all eternity. The fires of the room burn with a great intensity
making your eyes burn and your flesh blister and bubble.

Beowolf's Evil Room.~
An upside-down head sways back and forth before you. A tattered young
boy hangs from a meat hook cruelly pierced through his spine, his dead
eyes and mouth are open, and his intestines are hanging out of his
body dripping with blood. The room is filled with small children and
people of all ages hanging from the cold cruel iron. A small alley cat
sways back and forth, its neck pierced, and blood dripping from its 
blood soaked fur. Another young boy is still alive, struggling in vein,
his wrists have huge gashes and his blood creates a red ocean of beauty.
The boys screams are like pure Music to your ears. Naked and wide-eyed
a little girl is huddled cowering in the corner holding her dirty dolly
with passion. A huge spider crawls over her beaten, blood-smeared face
getting stuck in the white goop, which appears to be splotches on her 
body. You feel a good feeling burning inside your chest like an orgasm 
from all this ravishing beauty. This is the closest you've ever come to
the essence of life. You ask what love is? This is love...

statues and golden trinkets.  The thrown is emmence.  There are
hundereds of stairs before the thrown.  You are at the bottom.

Terram's Cave~
Colored light covers everything as you enter this large cave.  The 
ceiling is made of thousands of gems.  The floor is soft rich brown
loam.  The walls are living trunks of trees, interlaced with climbing
ivys.  Setting in one corner is a low table on a woven rug.  The 
opposite corner has a base for something made of solid granite.
