a merman~
A merman glares at you.
~
This beautiful half man and half fish floats gently in the water.  He
hates you for entering his element.  His tail thrashes the water into a
froth as he swims about.  The only thing he values is the beautiful pearls
found in the sea.

kelp~

The kelp moves restlessly in the sea.

The grey-green leaves and vines gently sway in the water.  The vines of
kelp intertwine to form a barrier.  The only way to clear the passageway
would be to cut a hole in the kelp.

The Aqueduct~
The curving walls extend up into darkness.  The floor slopes gently
downwards towards the center of the room.  A pool off dark stagnant water
reflects your light from a mere foot or two away.  Any sound you make echos
sickeningly off the vaulted ceiling.  A sound of moving water can be heard
to the east.  The stink of garbage and mold penetrates your clothes.

The Aqueduct~
The arching walls end in a circular room.  The floor is slippery with
algea and moss.  The floor slopes quite steeply down like a giant funnel. 
The water swirls around in a small whirlpool and gurgles as it is sucked
down.  As bits and pieces of decaying garbage are sucked under they break up
and release a sickening odor.

Water Passage~
You are soiled in a tourent of raining water and sewage.  The waters
swirl around in a malestorm.  Your sence of direction is lost as debree
buffets you.  You are finally flung into a corner.  Behind your back you
feel a pertrusion.  With a bit of work you should be able to climb free of
the whirlpool.

Water Passage~
The mix of water and waste continues to swirl around and buffet you. 
Pushing you along the tunnel towards the east.  Only near the ceiling can
you make any headway to the west.  All other sounds are drowned out by the
falling 'water' to the west.

Water Passage~
The slimy water has settled to steady flow down this long twisting
corridor.  The walls are smooth and slippery with a coating of ooze.  Most
of the larger debree has settled out or broken up.  The only sound is the
ever present sushing of water as it works its way downwards and south.

Water Passage~
You swim for quite some time.  Eventually you come to an old rusty grate.
The water is all a burble as it pours through the grate.  Water and trash
flow towards you from the north tunnel.  A large pile of debree has built up
on the floor under the grate.

Sea Tunnels~
This passage is vaguely circular, but definitely hand carved.  Vague
markings can be seen on the walls but they are very faint.  The dark water
sluggishly comes through a rusty grate to the west.  To the south this
passage connects to a strangely smooth tunnel.

#8107
Sea Tunnel~
This winding tunnel goes on for miles.  From the cinder on the bottom you
figure these tunnels to be lava tubes.  Hopefully the area is not active
anymore.  A slight current pulls you towards the west.  You have this
uncomfortable feeling that something lives in these underwater passages.

Sea Tunnel~
This cyndrical passage is a good ten feet wide.  The water to the west
feels slightly warmer.  You feel your clothing begin to itch as salt and
bits of decay saturate them.  Occasionally you catch glimse of movement in
the distance.

Sea Tunnel~
A vast undersea chamber surrounds you.  The walls and floor are black
volcanic obsidian.  Colorful coral forms the ceiling of the chamber.  The
water swirls gently as it enters this room.  From the north and west cold
inky black water flows gently in.  Warm water slowly seeps in from the
south.

Sea Tunnel~
The walls of the tunnels are a mix of rock and root.  Above you the
tunnel slowly turns into an interweaving of kelp vines.  To the north the
tunnel becomes almost solid stone.  The tide or current, your not sure which
applies, pulls you gently upwards.  You see an occasional odd fish or two
swimming among the roots.

Sea Tunnel~
The darkness is pierced from above.  Faint shafts of sunlight can be seen
far overhead.  A large jungle of kelp vines almost forms a tunnel with their
interwoven vines and leaves.  Small fish of many colors dart in and out of
cover in large schools.

Hole In The Kelp~
The sea water is warm an refreshing.  The salt water fills your mouth and
soaks your equipment.  The sunlight shines through the water above you. 
Large kelp vines sway gently in the current.  Below you you can just make
out an openning going down into the depths through the kelp.

A phosphorescent fungi lights this circular room in an eerie blue glow. 
Water gently laps at your ankles.  In the center of the room you see a large
open well.  A blackness in the fungi shows an opening overhead.  This must
be a long forgotten cistern that was once used to gather water.  Sniffing
the air you notice the smell of salt.

current pulling you towards a rusty grating covering the south wall of the
well.  You catch occasional glimses of a large white fish down the passages.

The black walls of the tunnel have closed in on you.  You can reach out
and touch the slimmy algea covered walls.  Your eyes ache from trying to
pierce the darkness.  You feel something brush the back of your hand. 
Jerking around, you glance but see nothing.  You see a small opening to the
east.

The water has deepened a bit and your legs are getting soaked.  A soft

nostrils.  Occasionally something small makes a wake in the water.  Very
faintly to the east you seen a weird blue glow.

Tunnel~
The tunnel has a decidedly uphill slant to the east.  The water is
pooling here but is only a couple inches deep.  The going is slow because of
the debree hidden under that water.  The odor of decay and must permeates
your clothes.  This tunnel is very quiet and each noise you make is echoed
in parodies of the original.

Leaking Tunnel~
You are floating in a pool of brackish water.  The stench of must
descends from the walls upon your poor nostrils.  Above you is a barely
discernable patch of blackness that might be an opening.  A stream enters
the pool from the west.  There is not much head room but you should be able
to breath the retched air if you follow the stream.

The stream is only thigh deep, but you must bend over to not bump your

To the north is a worked passageway.  You wonder who carved it so far down
below the sea.

Leaking Tunnel~
This hallway is done in elaborate style.  Rich mosacis of coral and
shells cover the walls.  Age has darkened many of the images.  A few have
been washed away by a near steady stream of water running down the wall. 
The floor is deeply eroded from water running down stream to the south.

Leaking Chamber~
This hallway goes about fifty feet to the west before it stops with a
cave in.  Water streams through the rocks and flows past you to the east. 
As you watch the ground shakes a little and the water starts to flow faster.
If your lucky you can get out before it caves in.

The chamber is a small temple.  Dominating the center of the room is an
altar in the shape of a tidal wave.  The wave motife flows across the floor
and up the walls.  Images of ceremonies and sea creatures intertwine with
the waves.  Water drips down along the west wall and runs along fancy
gutters to rain down over the entryway to the south.

You climb for hours and hours along this twisting tunnel.  Half natural

to do it.  The walls are damp from dripping water.  The only sound is the

Tunnel~
This winding tunnel seems to go on for quite some time.  You begin to
detect a definite slant upwards towards the north.  The trickles of water
have joined together to form a refuse filled stream down the middle of the
cooridor.  Each step kicks up the stench as garbage surfaces and laces the
air with the scent of decay.
