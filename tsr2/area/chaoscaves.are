This area was obviously a temple, and there is still a massive
altar against the center of the north wall. Midway between the altar and
the other three walls, the room is divided on three sides by massive floor
to ceiling columns. It is lit by two huge braziers, which burn with a 
flickering purple flame, even though no fuel is visible, and appear to give
off no heat. In fact, this room is noticeably colder than the hallway from
which you just entered. The room is huge, and there appear to be no exits
other than the doorway behind you.

drift lazily in midair above the seat of the throne, shifting about in an
endless jumble. The skull moves but is always facing outwards and turning
to look at you; the only bones that are not part of this endless, silent
slow dance are the intact feet of the skeleton. These are on the floor, 
positioned as if the skeleton is sitting on the throne.
         A small note lies at the skeleton's feet.

A Cozy Room.~

Furs cover the floor, and old, massive smoothly carved wooden furniture
lines the walls. The furniture consists of a large eating table, a sideboard,
three large reclining chairs woth foot-stools, and a high stool and a desk.
Two shelf units are also along the walls, home to bright displayed weapons
and a few thick books. On the far wall is a fireplace, a merry blaze 
crackling within it. It is surounded by an ornately-carved stone mantel
depicting armored human knights riding dragons and competing with elven
knigts on Pegasi. Overhead, the dragon- and Pegasi-riders motif is repeated
on the carved panels of the ceiling. Brass cloak-hooks project from a
human-sized arch of richly polished wooden panelling just inside the door.
The arch-topped panel contains a fold-down wooden bench, and is carved 
with a large, complex scene of birds singing over a pool where a unicorn
bends its head to drink. You don't hear anything but the faint crackle
of the fire.

         |    To understand Chaos one must understand Fate.   |
         |    Together Fate and Chaos are United. You see     |
         |    Fate brings us all together and it is Chaos     |
         |    that are the barriers in our lives. Chaos       |
         |    is any and all difficulties that you may        |
         |    face in your life to grow and become a better   |
         |    person. It is this view that we strive for in   |
         |    Chaos, because without Chaos in one's life      |
         |    one would be without guidance. Chaos is how     |
         |    we learn and become the great people that we    |
         |    are destined to be...                           |

         |    everything is going wrong then that is Chaos.   |

The Haze~
A blue haze seems to rise before your very eyes, silently and
rapidly, OBLITERATING the world around as you stare at the cryptic 
inscription. The inscription seems to consist of a number of names
and other nonsense, followed by the last line, glowing in deep blue
common lettering: "If you're reading this, of course, its too late." 
Blue radiance is everywhere; you are lost and floating somewhere not
quite real. Blue, shifting light is under, over, and all around you. 
The light begins to fade, and you realize that your legs and feet are
colder- and wetter- than the rest of you. You're somewhere else, all
light goes black and you are standing in inky, dark water as deep as your
thighs. A faint purple light comes from your left. Ahead of you, in the
distance, you hear the water rippling as something within it moves...

of many voices in the misty gloom. There are decorative carvings on the

and of fights with dragons. You feel completely at home here. Then one

working at the hearths and tables. If they weren't partially transparent,

For I am Stephan. Stephan, do you hear? The very name should make you

sequence in two or three minutes then begain again. Each time that the 
pictures change though, the scene is slightly different: a variation in
background, a different mage casting the spell, etc.

This room is filled with tables and benches formed from the stone
of the floor itself. They seem to have grown from the floor like some kind
of fungus. It is clean and orderly and even appears to be free of dust!

This is a great magical hallway. The air seems to be crisp and

and pictures of Chaos mages line the walls.

Mages' Brewery.~
This room looks like a normal kitchen, with a hearth at the east end
with a cheery fire blazing away in it- a bright green fire, that is. A bright
green fire with streaks of blue. The effect would really be quite attractive,
if it were not so startling.

Garbage.~
This room is completely bare, and the floor is level and unbroken.
You had come to expect a little room with a pit in the center for trash,
but you don't see one. Then you notice that your food is slowly evaporating.
It must be magic at work.

Store Room.~
This room is lined with shelves and filled with old rotten barrels
which obviously once held the food for the kitchen. It is surprisingly
bright in here, considering that you saw no hint of a light until you stepped
into this room. You notice as you enter and exit the room that the light
dims and brightens with your presence. It is very cold in here.

Necromancy Classroom.~
This classroom is decorated in somber shades of gray and black and 
wine red. The shelves which line the walls contain skulls- dozens of skulls
of many sizes. This room is where the mages of Chaos came to be taught about
death spells and the skulls were used to practice summoning the spirits of 
the dead.

Students' Private Room.~
You stand in a private bedroom of a young mage. This room is about
60' X 60' and is tidy. The debris in this room is neatly arranged and there 
is a bright light in one corner where a small pot sits. You look closer
and notice that the light is directed on the pot and there is a dead plant
sitting under the light. The young mage who lived here had created a light
spell for his plant.

Summoning Room.~
This room is huge, as well it might be; there are three protective
circles here of differing types. This room was obviously used for summoning
creatures from other planes. Many scorch marks from fire and other magic
lines the walls. This must have at one time been a very important room.

This room has two long, wide tables against the north wall. They
are covered with glassware and instruments of a mysterious nature. The room
is brightly lit by two huge braziers filled with bright blue flames. You
notice that the floor is covered with weird patterns, probably remnants
from lab experiments.

is a large table and three chairs, also well preserved. You can almost

A Lavish Room.~
This room was once rather comfortably appointed with two beds and
two chairs. The carvings on the walls are tasteful and soothing to the eye.
There is a fireplace on the west wall, and a muted yellow flame burns in 
the hearth. Although you sense no fuel or smoke, the fire seems to give
off a pleasant warmth that is welcome in these stone halls.

Headmaster's Bedroom.~
This room is a calm and quiet place, much at odds with the Chaos
of the rest of this area. There is a bed, a desk, and two chairs grouped
around the empty fireplace, all which seem to have once been made of fine
materials. Whoever loved here had very rich taste. In fact, he may still
be here- there is a long decayed body on the bed, in the remnants of rich
robes. A note is attached to the robes.

The Rainbow Room.~
This room seems almost empty, except for the debris of desks and 
chairs. But the walls seem to be of many different colors that shift and
sway and sparkle. The effect is almost hypnotic. The colors keep swaying
and moving...

Classroom.~
There are tables arranged thoughout the room with benches on one side
of them so that those seated would face the west wall. On the west wall is
a raised dais with a flat black space behind it for drawing various diagrams.
This appears to have been a classroom for young mages. In fact, there appears
to be a class in session at this moment. There is a robed form at the back
of the class facing the wall, and a group of vague dark forms sitting at 
the tables. You look more closely and see that it is really a ghost giving
a lecture to a class of shadows.

This room looks as if it was once a remarkably comfortable room.
The remains of four beds and four large armchairs still survive. The room
seems to be much cleaner than anywhere else you have seen. Perhaps some 
of the unseen servants take care of the chores.
