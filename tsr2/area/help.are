56 ''IMM AUTH' 'IMM AUTHORIZE'~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
Levels 51-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.

1 A~
.                MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
                ---------------------------
The game divided into many rooms which are connected by various
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to 
       exhaustion.  If you type SLEEP or REST your movement points will
       slowly be replenished.  You must type STAND or WAKE before 
       walking again.
~

53 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
Warning!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must
be Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed to you, only Lesser+
can assign themselves nonproto areas.

1 'ACETUM PRIMUS'~
'Acetum Primus,' is the third and most powerful of the known acid
disciplines at the Mage's disposal.  This incantation pulls forth the
strongest caustic agents in the casting Mage's neighboring planes,
and propels them in a tight cyclone-like blast towards the Mage's
chosen victim.  The cross-dimensional disturbance, the physical
violence, and the bonescouring potency of the conjured compound all
work together to effect an estimable estrapade.

0 ACHANGES~
Areas that are left to fix:
 
Sea's of Serenity, Mystic Landscapes, Thenia, Dragon Tower, Keep of Mahn Tor,
Island of Terror, Scottish Highlands, Sands of Sorrow, Thalos, Old Thalos, The
Caverns of Chaos, Yggdrasil, Ambush, Isles of the Pirate Lords, Divided Souls,
and Coven.
 
These areas will be done soon.

1 'ACID BLAST' 'BURNING HANDS' 'COLOUR SPRAY' FIREBALL 'LIGHTNING BOLT'

  'MAGIC MISSILE' 'SHOCKING GRASP'~
These are all attack spells and should not be used against another player
unless both you and the other player are listed under 'who deadly' and are
within the legal pkill level range.

1) Syntax:  cast fireball         <victim>
2) Syntax:  cast 'acid blast'     <victim>
3) Syntax:  cast 'lightning bolt' <victim>
4) Syntax:  cast 'colour spray'   <victim>
5) Syntax:  cast 'shocking grasp' <victim>
6) Syntax:  cast 'burning hands'  <victim>
7) Syntax:  cast 'magic missile'  <victim>
 
Each of these spells inflict variable damage on the victim.  The higher the
caster's level, the more damage inflicted.  The spells are listed by their
inherent power from strongest to weakest, though differences in strength
are in many cases minimal.
~

0 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~
Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'gas breath'
Syntax: cast 'lightning breath' <victim>

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
Gas breath is an area attack, the other breath spells are not.

61 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

53 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
 
~

53 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.

1 AFK~
Syntax: afk

The afk command will place an [AFK] flag beside your name on the who

1 ALIAS~
Syntax: alias
Syntax: alias <keyword>
Syntax: alias <keyword> <command phrase>
Syntax: unalias <keyword>
ALIAS by itself will give you a list of the aliases you have set. It will also
tell you how many aliases you have set out of the maximum total.
ALIAS <keyword> will show you what alias you have set does.
ALIAS <keyword> <command phrase> will create an alias to do <command phrase>
when you type <keyword>. If an alias already exists for <keyword> then it
will be replaced.
UNALIAS <keyword> will remove an alias that you have set.
Your aliases are saved with your character when you leave the game and will
be loaded when you come back.
Within your aliases you can use tokens, which start with a % for parameters.
The tokens which have an effect are %%, which just puts a % in the alias, %0,
which contains all the parameters you typed on the command line, and %1 through
%9 which contain the first 9 parameters passed on the command line. If you give
a parameter which was not passed, it will be blank when the alias is used.
For instance, if a player typed:
 > alias askabout tell %1 what do you think of %2?
Then typed:
 > askabout Zanna Galadrail
The mud would execute:
 > tell Zanna what do you think of Galadrail?
In this case, %0 would contain 'Zanna Galadrail', %1 would contain 'Zanna'
, %2 would contain 'Galadrail', and %3 through %9 would be blank./l

58 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax:  allow <site>
Syntax:  ban   <site>
Syntax:  ban
Syntax:  ban <# of ban on ban list> level <level of char to ban and below>
 
BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.
 
BAN with no arguments returns an enumerated list of banned sites.
 
To set a specific level of character to ban from a site, use 'ban' to get
the list number of the banned site and then use 'ban level'.
Example:  ban 2 level 10
 
This will ban all characters level 10 and under from the second site on
the 'ban' list.
 
ALLOW <site> removes a site from the ban list.
 
If you want to ban all players from a site ban sitename.com will work
there is no need for the * character. Just put the last two parts of
the site down. (example: ban aesir.com would ban anyone from aesir)

1 'ASTRAL WALK' 'FARSIGHT' 'TRANSPORT' 'PORTAL' 'HELICAL FLOW'~
Syntax:  cast 'astral walk'  <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'farsight'     <victim>
Syntax:  cast 'portal'       <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'transport'    <victim> 
Syntax:  cast 'helical flow' <victim>

caster's bidding:
 
'Astral walk' instantaneously moves the caster to the victim's location.
 
'Farsight' allows you to see the room in which the victim stands.
 
'Transport' sends an object in the caster's inventory to the victim.
 
'Portal' forms a temporary tunnel through space to the victim.  A portal
will not succeed if a portal already exists in either the caster's or
the victim's location.  If you able to scry, you can look into a portal
with 'look portal.'
 
'Helical Flow' morphs an Augurer into a coil of colour which instantly
travels to the victim's location.
 
These spells may fail if either the victim or the caster is in a location
which blocks their use, such as no-recall areas, no-summon areas, etc.

0 AUCTION~
Syntax: auction 
Syntax:	auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax:	auction bid <value>
Syntax:	auction stop
Syntax:	auction stat

The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing 
auction will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  

If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it will start at 0 
gold.

Auction stat will charge you 700 gold, but will display the stats of the 
item. 

Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item, and 
auction stop (immortals only) will stop an auction in progress. 

Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported here from a publicly available source.)

At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will soon be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction until level THREE or higher.  To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.

0 'AUGURER'~
The Augurer is very strong-minded in its nature, both physically and
magically. It is very confident of its actions in combat, and this
confidence shows in its physical appearance.  The Augurer is of a
medium height, with a defined bone structure which shows both
intelligence and assurance.  Its appearance is wizened, but at times
the Augurer may look frail due to exhaustion.  Though it is of a
medium size, its physical strength is not.  The Augurer relies on
both brain and brawn to overcome its challengers.  When it is
confronted, its wisdom decides what course of action it should take,
and wisdom is its prime stat.
 
While in combat, the Augurer is capable of utilizing both spells and
skills to their greatest potential.  However, because of the Augurer's
size, it tires of magic easily.  To overcome this mental exhaustion,
the Augurer is a strong believer in the use of mana for rejuvination
of its magical powers, and uses a lot of it.  In its spare time, the
Augurer enjoys the local lore, both the teaching and learning of it,
as well as musical and theatrical pursuits.  The Augurer is a very
independent person, and spends much of its spare time in meditation,
reflecting upon the days activities.

50 AVATAR~
Good work on making Level 50 (AVATAR) here. I need your help.
What do you think you guys should do next? I don't want to spend
a lot of time coding a remort system if everyone hates it. So
tell me your thoughts. I can do the following:
 
* You can retire.
* You can remort (start over at level 10 with 1/3 of your current hps)
* Choose to move on to Builder status. (see help create)
 
How are those options. If you guys have any other ideas please let me
know. Thanks for investing your precious time here on The Shadow Realms.

        creating all of your rooms and linking them. You must submit the
        idea for your area to Thallin and Beowolf for approval. Once you
        are given the go ahead by either of them you are to begin editing
        your rooms using goto vnum, where vnum is the assigned range of
        vnums given to you. Once you complete your rooms with everything
        you want them to be, ie, descriptions and valid directions please
        post a note in room 1202 on the builder board. You will need
        to say that you are done with your rooms and are requesting to
        have your area checked over. Once this is completed an immortal
        will go to your area and review it. He or she will then post a
        note on the builder board and let you know its been approved or
        if you need to make improvements. Once its been approved you will
        be advanced to the next level.

LEVEL - 52
----------

        This is the standard builder level. Builders with this level have
        the ability to create rooms, objects, mobs, and complete their
        area. At this level you are required to go through your area
        and finish it making mobs in the appropriate rooms and equiping
        the mobiles. Once you are done please post a note in room 1202
        saying that your area is complete. If you would like to learn 
        about roomprogs, objprogs, and mobprogs and how to code them you
        will need to pick up a copy of the prog doc off the web page
        and read it and understand it. Once you are done you will be
        required to submit working examples via email to beowolf@tsr.org
        for approval. If approved you may advance to master builder
        (level 53) where you will be allowed to create the progs for
        your area. If you are happy with your area and would rather not
        mess with progs then that is fine. All you need to do is post
        a note saying you would like to build another area. And start
        the basic process over, execpt you will remain at this level.
        Or you may choose to retire.

LEVEL - 53
----------

        Master Builder. You now have Roomprogs, Objectprogs, and Mobprogs
        at your disposal. You must display fluent coding abilities to
        be at this level since you may damage the mud if you mess up.
        Please take your time when creating progs for your area. If you
        remain at this level for more than 3 months and create at least
        4 unique areas and display that you would make a good immortal
        then you will be promoted accordingly. To get an immortal
        please be sure you meet the above requirements and then post
        a note on the Builder board in 1202 stating your desire and
        list your accomplishments on the MUD.

~

51 BRULES 'builder rules'~
RULES FOR THE BUILDERS OF TSR


1)  Please do not use your character to role-play with the players
    of the MUD. This includes using the gossip channel. You should
    NOT use this channel for any reason. You may however chat when
    your taking a break on the ooc channel.

2)  You should use the avtalk channel for ALL questions regarding
    building your area. All characters with the ] after their name
    (ie. Rahvan] ) are builders. All Characters with the : after their
    name (ie. Beowolf: ) are immortals.

3)  You must show that you want to be a builder to keep your builder
    status. If you do not work on your area for a period of one month
    while creating your first area, you will be assumed MIA and be
    promptly deleted.

4)  If you have completed one area and do not show intrest in building 
    another area you will be considered retired and be placed as a 
    retired builder.

5)  Please do NOT use goto OTHER than to build your area or stay in the
    vnum range of 1200-1299. If you are caught using goto to explore
    current areas or going to mortals you will be deleted. You may
    however, if asked by another builder or immortal check out thier
    area, but ONLY if asked by them. So basically stay in your assigned
    vnum range or the 1200-1299 vnum range and no where else.

6)  You may NOT run any quests or interfere with any roleplaying in the
    MUD. Your job is to create fun and unique areas not to play.

7)  You may have mortal characters who play the MUD. However using your
    builder character to give them special items is against the rules and
    you will be deleted for breaking this rule.

8)  You room descriptions should be a min. of 4 lines long. Try and use
    proper English and spelling. Room descriptions with dialog are NOT
    acceptable. Also room descriptions that contain things such as you
    think, or you wonder, or in general the word "you" are not acceptable.
    However there are exeptions to this but these are rare. Be as 
    descriptive as possible. Make the person who is reading the descript
    see what your seeing in your mind. If you get stuck think of these
    things: what do you see? What does it smell like in the room? What is
    the floor like? Anything special ever happen in this room? Are there
    hidden things in this room and if so what might be the clue to finding
    it?

9)  ALL objects should have a PLUS and a MINUS to them. So have a reason
    for people to wear the eq, but at the same time have a reason that
    the eq might suck. So if the item adds 100 hp to the char it might
    subtract 100 mana from them or take away 2 str. We are striving for
    balanced equipment here.

10) TITLES. You have the power to set your own title. Please do NOT set
    your title to something to the effect of is sad today. or anything
    cheesy. The best title would reflect something that has to do with
    your area. Example: Beowolf is building the Halls of Chaos.

11) Do NOT give out ANY information to the players of the MUD pertaining to
    areas, levels, or any information that the mortal would not normally
    have. 

Failure to comply by any of the above rules will result in some form of 
punishment up to deletion if we feel it is appropriate.

A cleric is a healer and protector of the weak.  Clerics have in their
control many varied and sundry healing spells, as well as spells to affect
one's chances in battle, and one's armor.  Clerics do possess some combat
spells and skills, but combat is far from the focus of the class.  The
cleric is a fountain of wisdom and healing that many players rely on.

outcast, but function to induct or outcast members from councils.
 
Coinduct will bring a new player into the council.
Cooutcast will remove them from the council.
 
~

1 COMBAT~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indictate how hard a fight might be.  You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.

1 DEADLY~
A "Deadly" character is one who shows up under the Deadly Characters portion
of the Who list (type 'who deadly' to see a list deadly characters online).
Your character will be deadly if you choose the path of the pkillers when
you first entered the game.  You are not officially a Deadly character
until your name shows up on 'who deadly'.
~

1 'DEADLY CLANS~
Clans are societies composed of a group of players which have joined 
together under a common cause.  If you are a member of a clan you have
the ability to pkill other deadly players outside of your own clan.
Depending on the clan you join, you may be asked  to follow set of
rules dictated by the clan's leaders. 
 
NOTE: Non-deadly and deadly players may join a deadly clan, however when
the character is outcasted it remains deadly.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the Altar to Thoric in
Darkhaven (or your clan's temple).  Your corpse is left behind where you
were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with
you (the gods want you to have your gold).
 
Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.
 
Following and groups are not affected by death.
 
You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is back to the
beginning of your level.  Thus if you have a bad day and die several times,
the penalties won't clobber you.
 
Corpses decay after time, and when this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it.  Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time
(15 minutes of real time).  Only the player who died or someone in the same
group can retrieve objects from a player's corpse.  The only exceptions are
for deadly characters, who can loot each other's corpses at will.

1 DEXTERITY DEX~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash and stun, and helps determine whether a thief
   will be able to poison a weapon.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.
~

61 DIAGNOSE~

supports full BEDMAS expressions ( ) ^^ / * + -, plus extra mud related
operators and variables:

D dice         L level          H hit points      M mana
V movement     S strength       I intelligence    W wisdom
X dexterity    C consitution    A charisma        U luck
Y age
 
See SMAUGSPELLS and SSET.
~

0 DIG DIGGING BURY BURYING~
Syntax:  dig
Syntax:  dig  <direction>
Syntax:  bury <item>
 
You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of spells such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

-1 DIKU~
Realms of Despair was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
          Michael Seifert                 [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.
~

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods upon an evil victim.  If you do
not specify a target, the spell's effect will strike you instead of a
secondary target.
~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on a character.  It may be used as
an offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a
benign spell to remove one's own magical handicaps.
 
WARNING:  dispel magic is an offensive spell when cast on anyone other
than yourself, and will possibly begin a battle with the victim.
 
* DO NOT cast dispel magic on another player character unless you both
appear under the 'deadly characters' section of the who list!
~

1 DISRUPTION~
With the spell 'Disruption,' the casting Mage causes his opponent to
be enveloped in a weird energy field that momentarily alters the plane
which the victim inhabits.  The spell was an early attempt by the Dark
Mage Thanatos to cause teleportation, but it was a failed attempt.  
Instead of teleporting it causes a horrendous nerve-wracking pain as
the victim exits and reenters his current plane of existence.

~

0 DRUID~
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always strives to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.

duel not stated as illegal will be considered legal.
 
The administration of the Arena is the purview of the Pkill Conclave, and
all concerns regarding its operation should be first addressed to them.
* Note that no immortal is ever required to oversee a duel.
** Non-deadly versus Deadly duels are not possible.
~

0 DWARF DWARVES DWARFS~
Dwarves are relatively short (in Human terms), stocky and powerfully-built
creatures.  Long-lived and extremely sturdy, they are known equally as well
for their hardiness as for their cantankerous personalities.  Their thick,
stout frames lend them poor dexterity, but high strength and stamina.  This
race has produced some of the most reknowned fighters.  Dwarves possess the
inherent ability to see in the dark with infravision.
 
Dwarves average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with dusky
complexions and thick, fur-covered torsos and limbs.  Both men and women
proudly wear and take pride in their beards.

0 EAT DRINK~
Syntax:  drink <object>                  (drink liquid from a drink container)
Syntax:  eat   <object>                  (eat food or a magical pill)
         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.
 
~

51 ECHO RECHO~
Syntax:  echo  <message>
Syntax:  recho <message>
 
ECHO sends a message to all players in the game, without any prefix
indicating who sent it. 
 
RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.
~

51 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.
 
See ASET, FOLDAREA
~

0 'ELDRITCH SPHERE'~
This powerful spell increases your resistence to both magical and nonmagical
attacks.
~

0 ELF ELVES~
Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and dexterity
of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than Humans,
what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with their superior
agility - both in thought and movement.  Elves are capable in all classes,
though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter.  Most Elves will
prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.  All Elves have
the inherent ability to detect magic.
 
The average Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six feet.
Most have fair skin and long, straight hair, though there are individual
Elves who chose a darker life reflected in their outward appearance.

~

0 'ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>
 
This spell imbues a weapon with a magical enchantment, increasing its to-hit
and to-dam bonuses.  The weapon must be non-magical to start with, else the
enchantment will not succeed.  This spell also causes the weapon to be
aligned with the alignment with the caster.
~

0 'ENERGY DRAIN'~

This spell saps the experience points, mana, and movement points of its
target.  This is an attack spell and should not be used against other

~

0 ENTER LEAVE~
Syntax:  enter
Syntax:  leave
 
In rooms either 'somewhere' exits or exits responding only to keywords,
you can simply type 'enter' or 'leave' to pass through that exit.
 
The most common use of this is with portals cast by mages.  To use the
portal, simply type 'enter' on either side of it and you will pass
through to the other side.
~

1 EQDAMAGE~
While in combat, you may notice that your equipment is taking damage.  For
example, you may see "Your lifebane gets damaged."  Each time this happens,
the AC of the item is damaged by one.  If the AC on an item is 5, after it
is damaged more than five times it will be destroyed or scraped.
 
If you wish to preserve the equipment, you must repair it by taking it to
the town blacksmith. (NOTE:  Not all equipment is repairable)  You may also
notice that while fighting a creature which attacks you with acid breath or
another acid attack, your equipment gets "etched and pitted."  When this
occurs the AC on that item is damaged by one permanently.  You cannot
repair the damage done by "pitting and etching."
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment
Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
INVENTORY lists your inventory.
~

1 'ETHEREAL FIST'~
'Ethereal Fist' is an odylic enchantment in which the casting Mage
conjures from the ether about himself a solid manifestation of a
cubical volume of ether.  As if this weren't great fun in and of
itself, the final syllables of the spell cause the fist to 
repeatedly and mercilessly pound into a victim of the caster's choice.
 
Fun to cast in a room by yourself, and always a hit at parties,
'Ethereal Fist' is a low-level Mage's best friend.
 
~

0 'ETHEREAL FUNNEL' ETHEREAL FUNNEL~

~

51 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

51 EXITTYPES~
These are the currently valid exit-types:
      0 - Plain exit
      1 - Door exists         (Required to be closed or locked)
      2 - Door is Closed
      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'redit exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Syntax:  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a spell through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.
~

1 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL'~
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
forumla would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

0 FEED~
Syntax: feed
 
Vampires require copious amounts of blood to function properly, and
often the small puddle remaining after a kill is insufficient to
satiate the Hunger.  Thus, the Vampire will often need to grapple
with a victim in an attempt to feed from the living veins.
 
To 'feed', the Vampire must be engaged in combat; simply type 'feed'
while fighting.  If the bite succeeds a small amount of damage will
be done and a varying amount of blood will be drawn.

of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>; Syntax: group <character>; Syntax: group
 
'Follow' starts you following another character.  To stop following, type
'follow self'.  You cannot follow those more than ten levels above you.
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows a leader to disband his group (members stop following
 and are ungrouped).
~

59 FOR~
Syntax:  for <argument> <command>
Syntax:  for <argument> <command> <target>
 
For allows an immortal to perform a command at or even on a large
number of targets.  The arguments include:  all, mobs, gods.
 
Example:  for gods gl, you will 'glance' in the room of every god
who is online (include link-dead)
 
You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on
every mob in the game.
 
'For' does not override private flags.
~

52 FORCE~
Syntax:  force <victim> <command>
Syntax:  force all <command>
 
Force forces one mob or character to execute a command.
 
FORCE 'all' forces _all_ everywhere in the game to execute a command,
typically used for 'force all save'.
 
Note that the level required to use force on mobs can be different
than the level required to use force on players, and can be adjusted
via 'cset' (see 'help cset').
 
~

56 FORCECLOSE~
Syntax: forceclose <descriptor>

This command will force a certain descriptor to close.
This is useful to disconnect connections that aren't really connected
due to a poor TCP connection.

It can also be used to forceclose a connection before a potential
problem player can even get to the authorization state of connection.

See USERS, CONSTATES and DISCONNECT.
~

61 FORMPASS~
Syntax:  formpass <new password> <character name>
Example: formpass temporary Joseph
                                       
Used to help in changing a character's password if they have forgotten or
misplaced their own.
 
This command will return the encrypted form of the specified password for
the specified character name.  Password and character name are case
sensitive, and the character name _must_ be capitalized.  The resulting
encrypted password must then be pasted into the character's pfile offline
by someone with access to player files.
 
~

51 FQUIT~
Syntax:  fquit <character>
 
Can be used by low-level imms to force a level 1 player to quit the game,
for example if the player is accidentally authorized or is causing problems
and there are no higher immortals around to deal with the problem.  Fquit
does not work on any player higher than level 1.

~

37 GATE~
Syntax: cast gate

This spell gates in a guardian vampire.  Player characters don't have much use
for it, but high demons, and guardian vampires themselves, like it a lot.
~

0 GITH~
The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.
~

1 GLANCE~
syntax:  glance
syntax:  glance <victim>
 
Glance alone shows you only the contents of the room you are in,
eliminating the description.  Glance <victim> shows only the health
condition, eliminating their description and equipment from your
screen.
 
Glance may be abbreviated as 'gl'.
~

1 GLORY~
Glory is a measure of how valiant you are, and is accumulated by taking part
in quests and the like by the immortals.   It appears in 'score' as:
 
                    Glory: 264(430)
 
The number in parentheses is the total lifetime glory attained by a character,
and the other number is your current glory.  Glory can be "spent" to improve
items, weapons and the like.
~

1 GOLD~
Syntax:  gold
 
Displays the current total gold you are carrying.
~

0 GOSSIP . MUSIC ASK ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: gossip   <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: ask      <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all interested 
players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The ASK and ANSWER commands 
both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
~

52 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

If the location is a vnum, and it does not already exist, and it is within
your room vnum range; it shall be created for your to edit further with
REDIT.

You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

See REDIT.

Brave Adventurer, Who Are You? -> ~

1 GRIP~
This skill is automatic, once practiced.  The skill causes you to grip
your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.
~

54 GRUB~
Here is some reference data you will need in order to use GRUB.
 
Sex          Class       Race         Fields   Clans        Councils
0 Neutral  0 Mage      0 Human        Name     1 1st Guild  1 1st Council
1 Male     1 Cleric    1 Elf          Sex      2 2nd Guild  2 2nd Council
2 Female   2 Thief     2 Dwarf        Class    3 ... so on  3 ... so on
           3 Warrior   3 Halfling     Race
           4 Vampire   4 Pixie        Level
           5 Druid     5 Vampire      Room
           6 Ranger    6 Half Ogre    Gold
           7 Augurer   7 Half Orc     Clan
                       8 Half Troll   Council
                       9 Half Elf     Site
                      10 Gith         Last
                                      Pkill
 
Here are some sample uses of GRUB:
 
grub 20 pkill=y class=5      Display 20 Druid pkillers
grub 20 level=2 last<=970120 Display 20 L2 players absent since 970120
grub 20 level>=20 level<=30  Display 20 players levels 20 thru 30
grub  0 level=2              Count the number of level 2 players
grub 20 level>50 gold>100000 Display 20 imms with more than 100k gold
grub 50 damroll>100 sex=2    Display 50 females with damroll>150
grub  0 class=5 damroll>150  Count the number of druids with damroll>100
grub 20 site=123.456.789     Display 20 players from site 123.456.789
grub 10 class=0 race=2       Display 10 dwarven mages
grub  1 name=Joe             Display Joe's info
grub 20 room=7070 class=0    Display 20 mages who logged off in 7070
grub  0 class!=2 class!=3 class!=4   Count the number of mana users
 
You always need to specify the number of lines you want displayed. The
reason for that is that we don't want to ask for a list and then get
surprised to find that it's 15,000 lines long. You can get a count
of the players that match your criteria by requesting zero lines.
 
GRUB will tell you how many lines there are in the list n matter how
many you ask to display. So if there are 15,000 players that meet yur
criteria and you ask for the first ten, GRUB will tell you there are
15,000 in total but will only show you the first ten.
 
See also: HELP 'GRUB EXAMPLES'
~

54 'GRUB EXAMPLES~
Here are some examples illustrating common usages:
 
Example:
 
grub 20 or hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
Suppose you want to search for "suspicious players". Suppose you want
to see players who have more than 200 million gold or whose damroll
exceeds 150 or whose hitroll exceeds 150 you can do that as follows:
 
Normally GRUB lists players who satisfy all the conditions you specify.
But it can also be used like this to list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
The operand "or" ensures GRUB will list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
If you had specified:
 
grub 20 hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
That would show you players whose hitroll exceeds 150 and whose damroll
exceeds 150 and whose gold exceeds 200 million. It would be a much
smaller list and you would miss many suspicous players.
 
Example:
 
grub 20 name>ska name<skb room>=21000 room<=21499
 
Suppose someone complains that a player with a name like "Skathamaga"
picked up some of their eq and promptly quit the game. The player isn't
sure of the exact name of the thief but is sure it starts with "Ska".
The thief quit the game somewhere in New Darkhaven (vnums 21000-21499).
 
This example will show you players whose name starts with "Ska" and who
last quit the mud somewhere in New Darkhaven.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
 
All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
 
~

0 GUILDS~
Syntax:  guilds
 
Displays a list of currently operating guilds, their leaders, their
mkills (number of mobs killed by guildmembers) and mdeaths (number
of members killed by mobs).
~

0 GUILDTALK~
Syntax:  guildtalk <message>
 
Provided that you are in a Guild, guildtalk will send the message to
all members currently online.

~

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
A mixing of Human and Elven blood, these attractive creatures are neither
as intelligent as full-blood Elves (but moreso than Humans), nor as hardy
as full-blood Humans (but moreso than Elves).  They serve best in classes
which require a mix of mental and physical strength without demanding
superiority in either.  Half-elves carry the inherent Elven ability to
see limitedly in the dark with infravision.
 
Though not as tall as a pure-blood elf, a half-elf is a relatively tall
creature ranging from five foot five inches tall to six foot five inches,
with a generally more muscular build than the pure-blooded elf.
 
~

0 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
Half-Ogres are offspring of the successful coupling of the neanderthal-like
Ogre with and Humans.  Standing from six to nine feet in height and packed
with bulging muscles, Half-Ogres possess great physical abilities, enabling
this race to thrive in battle.  Half-ogres tend to be less quick-witted
than humans and, like their pure-blood Ogre relatives, are aggressive in
the extreme, often engaging in battle to establish superiority, leaving the
loser shunned as a weakling incapable of survival.  Because of their human
parentage, Half-Ogres are not as large or powerful as pure-breed Ogres, but
nevertheless boast truly awesome strength.  Half-Ogres possess infravision.
 
The torso and limbs of many Half-Ogre are commonly covered in small, boney
growths.  Most are relatively hairless, with disproportionally long limbs,
giving many an ape-like appearance.  Their weight runs from three hundred
to four hundred pounds.
 
~

0 HALF-ORC HALF-ORCS HALFORC HALFORCS~
A recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad
bodies, their poor mental and physical dexterity is offset by an iron
constitution.  Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to
their human influence, brute combat is is still the natural call which
stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs possess infravision.
 
Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.
Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two hundred pounds,
an altogether fearsome race.
 
~

0 HALF-TROLL HALFTROLL~
An intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the world) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.  Though naturally of
low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a wicked intelligence
and the ability to see naturally in the darkness.  Half-trolls usually
make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an unusually low dexterity.
Yet their boundless energy and high intellect create one of the most
cunning physical beasts in experienced hands.
 
Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.
 
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
Short, slender, bull-headed and very mischievous the Halfling has a level
of dexterity which knows no equal, and many enjoy the thrill of stealing
valuables from other people.  Many halflings choose the path of the Thief,
for which their silent footstep and nimble fingers serve them well.  This
dexterity coupled with a surprising fearlessness makes them a ferocious
(though somewhat underpowered) opponent.
 
Halflings have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and are usually
covered from head to toe in hair of varying thickness and color.
 
~

58 HEDIT~
Syntax:  hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you.  The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name>
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated
       with that keyword may already exist.
 
See also HSET.
~

51 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not 
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>."
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours."  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

To release a player from hell early, simply "unhell <character>".  
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP without any arguments shows a one-page command summary.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include

~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
If you successfully HIDE, other characters and creatures cannot see you
unless they are affected by 'detect hidden'.
 
If you successfully SNEAK, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other characters.
 
In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.
 
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.
~

60 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
Hitall is a fighter skill that will start a fight by hitting all the
opponents in the room.  For nondeadly characters, the 'opponents' means
mobs, for deadlies it means all the deadly players in the room.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
 
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>
 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.

51 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

10 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>
 
example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html
 
If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they
select the 'see who's on' link from the Realms of Despair
home page.
 
To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.
~

1 'HP'~
This is an abbreviation for hit points.  All classes begin with 20 hp
at creation and gain between 6 and 19 hp per gained level, depending on
class, race and CON.  Equipment can also add to your total hp.
~

58 HSET~
Syntax:  hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
Humans are the most numerous and least unusual of the races.  They possess 
no special abilities or bonuses, but also have no penalties.  Because of
this, Humans are extremely adaptable and are able to assume a variety of
classes and roles.
 
Humans are bipedal beings, boasting two arms, two legs and a roundish head.
Amazingly, Humans have a strange tendency to look different from each the
other; almost none look exactly alike.

15 'IMC RULES'~
These are the rules to follow when using IMC.
 
1.) Do NOT ask over IMC how to use an IMC channel. 
    Keep those questions to the MUD itself. Ask someone.
 
2.) No Swearing or Foul language is allowed over IMC.
 
3.) No Spamming over IMC. 
 
4.) As much as I love everyone do NOT Advertise for the MUD over IMC.
 
5.) If you don't like someone, ignore them. Don't start a War over IMC.
 
6.) IMC is Out Of Character. I put it in so you could have another
    "Chat" channel for OOC. This time letting you talk to all muds.
 
HELPS ARE LOCATED IN HELP "IMC"
~

65 IMCNOTES~
Notes (boards, mail, etc) are very mud-dependent, but in general, if they
have been connected to IMC, then you can simply write notes to player@mudname
in addition to normal 'player'.
For example, you may be able to do:
note to abcde@somemud anotherplayer immortal@someothermud
and the note would go to:
  abcde on the mud called 'somemud'
  anotherplayer on your mud
  all immortals on the mud called 'someothermud'
The 'playernames' used are interpreted by the mud that receives them, not
your mud, so be careful when writing notes to group names such as 'immortal'.
If your note cannot be delivered within 12 hours for some reason (if the
mud is down, does not exist, or refused your mail) then you will get a note
from the system telling you so.

54 IMMLEVELS 'IMM LEVELS'~
HOW TO GET THAT NEXT IMM LEVEL

LEVEL - 54
----------
     Evaluation period. You must stay active for at least 30 days in the

     things asked of you by Beowolf or the exitsting heiarchy,  writing up 
     a valid history for yourself and having it approved by Variant, 
     staying wizi without ANY contact whatsoever with ANY of the mortals 
     for a period of  at least 1 week. Once this is done, You will 
     played into the MUD and a letter will be written stating that you 
     are allowed to go visable.  If all this is complete and the 30 days 
     is up then you will be evaluated by the existing immortal staff and 
     voted on for promotion.

LEVEL - 55
----------

     Your main purpose for this level is to role-play with the mortals. You 
     must do this for at least another 30 days.  Another aspect of this 
     level is to begin to enforce all rules. Memorize the rules, find and 
     locate bugs within the MUD, run 1 Quest every 2 weeks, and be sure 
     to unwizi and personally greet EVERY newbie (level 1) that Enters 
     the MUD. Make them feel welcome and let them  know that if they need 
     anything within reason that you will do your best to help them. If you 
     complete all this please post a note on the immortal board in room 
     1200,  AFTER 30 days saying that you feel that you are ready for 
     promotion. Please be sure to include a list of deeds that you have 
     accomplished. Once this is done you will be voted on for promotion.

LEVEL - 56
----------

      You must continue to do your best to do everything that a level 55 is 
      required to do. You now have a big task in front of you. Try and 
      spice up certain areas by adding roomprograms, mobprograms, or 
      object programs. If you do not wish to try this then you must at 
      least complete 1 area. (50 rooms at least) Continue to role-play 
      and keep an eye on things. After another 30 days please follow the 
      same procedure that you did to obtain this level. (ie. post a note)

LEVEL - 57
----------

      Continue to do everything from the previous levels. Now the main thing 
      you need to concentrate on is a HUGE quest involving yourself and 
      as many of the mortals as you can get to participate. You must 
      give the mortals at least 1 week in prepration for this event. It must 
      be so big that it will affect the mythos of the MUD.  You will also 
      need to start planning for your sect or demi-sect  depending on how 
      many sects the MUD currently has.  Start thinking about how your sect 
      will come into power, think out a story and submit it to Variant. 
      Also start constuction of your sect or demi-sect area. Once this is 
      complete please post a note on the Immortal Board again.

LEVEL - 58
----------

       Your now ready for sect or demi-sect options.  Please learn the new 
       commands at your disposure. continue to guide the mortals but now 
       help lower level immortals with questions or problems. You now 
       receive one vote for all voting options. Also you may now help us pay 
       for the site if you so feel to desire. By helping us pay for the 
       site you will receive one extra vote. So instead of your  vote 
       counting for 1 it counts as 2. Please post a note on the Immortal 
       Board if you would like to help pay for the site. Basically you  
       need to establish your sect or demi-sect by role-playing your ass 
       off, so no extra work is required. In fact you do not even have to 
       run a Quest at this level unless you really want to. After 30 days 
       post a note on the Admin Board  in 1201 for promotion.

LEVEL - 59
----------

       Now that your sect or demi-sect is established you must do everything 
       above, including Quests again. Promote role-playing and the rules 
       of the MUD. You must also do your best to advertise for the MUD.
       This means but is not limited to, posting notes on the newsgroups 
       (rec.games.mud.diku, alt.mud, and rec.games.mud.admin) Next you 
       must create a intense area for the mud using a very complex area
       consisting of mobprogs, roomprogs, and objprogs. You must also 
       continue to vote on important matters. Find bugs in areas and you 
       may also opt to help Beowolf code if you would like to learn.
       In order for you to help Beowolf you must learn the C language on 
       your own first. Once this is done simply post a note to him 
       letting him know your interested. Choosing the option to help code
       is by no means required, but if you do choose this you must have 
       a UNIX or Linux account on a machine somewhere. (a shell account  
       with an editor like VI.) Once you complete what you feel is a good 
       job post a note on the Admin Board in room 1201 for promotion. The 30 
       days here is not required.

LEVEL - 60
----------

        Welcome to the coder and upper admin levels. These levels are 
        restricted to those who have devoted much time and effort to get 
        here. It is prefered that if you can help us pay for the site that 
        you now do so. If you can not do this it isn't a big deal. At 
        this level you have 2 votes if your not helping pay for the site 
        and 3 if you are. At this level you begin creating SPELLS for the 
        mud using the OLC for spells. You must create at least 10 new 
        spells. You must also help lower level immortals out with 
        problems and resolve problems with the mortals. Help come up with at 
        least 4 new ideas that will improve the MUD. Once this is done 
        post a note on the Admin board.

LEVEL - 61
----------

        Your getting up there. Now that you have worked with the OLC for  
        spells. Create another 10 spells and create 2 new areas. Other than 
        that continue to do everything else you have been doing to get 
        here. Also you will need to check all the NEW builders areas for 
        bugs and creativity. You will also check on immortals areas that 
        are lower level than you. You will now continue to do this as
        you rise in levels.

LEVEL - 62
----------

        Keep your eye on everything. Create at least 5 spells and run a few 
        Quests. Take a breather. Heh. Stay at this level for at least 14 
        days then post a note on the Admin board.

LEVEL - 63
----------

        Your one away from the MAX level that you can obtain. Write 1 area 
        that kicks ass. Role-play and provide input. Help out all mortals 
        and immortals. Stay at this level for at least 30 days. Then post
        a note on the Admin board.

LEVEL - 64
----------

        You've made it to the top level that you can obtain. Help ALL 
        immortals and mortals. Continue to run at least 1 quest per 
        month. Vote on issues and help make this the best environment that 
        it can be. Write up helpfiles for new commands that Beowolf 
        codes. Make changes to areas that need it and have fun. Relax and 
        enjoy yourself. If something goes wrong then use your best judgement
        if Beowolf is not on to resolve the problem. This way all Beowolf 
        has to worry about is getting stuff coded.

~

59 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax:  installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>
 
Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.  The
filename can be fixed with aset (don't forget to foldarea afterwards).

This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.
~

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:

 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.
~

0 INVIS 'MASS INVIS'~
Syntax: cast invis <character>
Syntax: cast 'mass invis'

The INVIS spell makes the target character invisible.  Invisible characters
will become visible when they attack.

The MASS INVIS spell makes all characters in the caster's group invisible,
including the caster.

54 IRULES 'commandments' 'immortal rules' 'beo's law' ~
THE IMMORTAL RULES OF TSR
			       'Beo's LAW'

1.)  Please respect the hierarchy of the realms. This means that if a 
     immortal of a higher level asks you to do something then do it. 

2.)  DO NOT kill mortals for the fun of it. This includes transferring 
     aggressive mobs to players. The ONLY exception to this rule is if 
     a mortal is disrespecting you by OOC: calling you names.

3.)  Please use AUTHORIZATION with care. Do NOT let any names in the MUD 
     that do not reflect the role-playing environment. This includes, but 
     is not limited to names such as Ladybug, JuJuFruit, Beavis, Buttmonkey, 
     and names that contain graphical words found in 'R' rated movies.

4.)  Do not give out information such as directions to areas, stats of 
     other players, the location of a player, or the level of another 
     player to mortals.

5.)  Do NOT raise stats, or change any of the players information 
     (ie. gold or trains) unless you are doing so for a reward for 
     a BIG QUEST.

6.)  Do not load eq for players unless there has been a crash and that 
     mortal needs reimbed. If this is the case load only a max. of 5 
     items for that player and place a note on the immortal board 
     saying whom you restored and what time it was.

7.)  Do not give out EQ unless its for a quest prize or for testing an 
     area. If you do give out an item for testing an area please make 
     sure to get it back when you are done.

8.)  You may NOT get into an OOC argument on the open channels that 
     mortals can hear. If you disagree about something please argue 
     with each other on the immortal channel. If the immortal that 
     you are arguing with is a higher level than you are, then the 
     higher level will get his or her way. If you feel that they were 
     wrong for their judgment call please note to Beowolf. However, 
     if its simply too silly I will not hesitate to demote you a level. 
     There is no need for immortals to argue over things.

9.)  If you see a player that is getting WAY out of control with you 
     please try to capture the argument or LOG it if you have the 
     log command. If you capture it please submit a copy to beowolf@tsr.org

10.) You should follow everything you need to do in help immlevels.

11.) You should always present a UNITED front to the mortals. They look 
     to us for support and guidance and if we falter they will walk all 
     over us.

12.) Please, try not to cheat with your mortal characters!!! I really 
     hate seeing this happen. If your going to play here with a mortal 
     at least try to do it the right way. You will NOT have any special 
     privileges and will be treated by the same laws that govern the 
     mortals. If you get pissed at another mortal for something don't go 
     getting all pissed off and bringing your god on, or saying, well 
     I'm a god here and you suck. or anything to that nature. I know 
     this happened when we were running the other code, but I want things 
     to be run as they should here. So basically DON'T cheat with your 
     mortal!!!

13) If a player gets out of control then put them in HELL. Use that hell 
    command and place a note on the immortal board stating how long that 
    player should be in there. PLEASE be sure to note it!!! 

14) Joking around on the imm channel - Please be careful when joking around 
    on the immortal channel. Remember that builders also get this channel. 
    So if you want to make it personal and joke around use a tell or if 
    your level 60 or higher use the ADMIN channel. However just joking 
    around with each other is perfectly fine, its not however when you 
    use personal things that the other immortal does not want every imm 
    to know.

RULES FOR SECT AND DEMI SECT GODS AND GODDESSES.

15) Do NOT go overboard with it. This means being a complete ass about 
    your actions. All the other immortals should know what your planning 
    inside your sect so that we can work as a team to make an excellent 
    story for the players.  

16) Follow the guidelines for creating a sect or demi-sect area found in 
    help sectarea.
 
17) Failure to comply by ANY of these rules includes but is not limited 
    to: First offense is a warning. Second offense is demotion. Third 
    is another demotion until you reach level 54 and if you break it 
    again you will be deleted. Also once you get demoted you have to 
    start all over with what it says you have to do in help immlevels 
    regardless of what you got done up to that point.

18) ALL of these rules are subject to change at ANY time by Beowolf 
    without warning or reason. Please walk safely and carry your slay 
    command with hopes of finding an out of control mortal.

It can be cast on yourself or other players.
~

Languages alone shows which languages you know, and "language learn

language, a scholar who is knowledgable in that tongue must be present.

If someone is speaking in a language, and you know it, you will 
understand what they are saying.  However, to change the language in which 
you are speaking, you must change that manually.  (See help on SPEAK).

Also see help on TONGUES.

53 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.
 
Valid numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

See FORCE.
~

This spell reveals the location of all objects with the given name.
~

54 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax:  log   <character>
Syntax:  log   all
Syntax:  snoop <character>
 
LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.
 
Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
 
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
 
~

1 LOYAL LOYALTY~
The item flag 'loyal' reflects a weapon's loyal status.  Such a weapon will
return to a player's inventory when disarmed.
 
Note that a weapon will only be loyal to a deadly character, and it will be
loyal regardless of whether or not a mob or a player (peaceful or deadly)
disarms the wielder.  Non-deadly characters will gain no advantage with
a loyal weapon.
 
~

0 MAGICUSER MAGE MAGES~
A mage is one of the weakest class when it comes to body, but their minds
have no par.  As a mage you will begin weak, but as you grow in knowledge
and power, you will become a powerful fighting force.  Mages' spells are
varied and sundry, but they get many more combat spells than the clerics.
With a mage's vast repertoire of useful spells you will become a much
sought after commodity ... for your spells can mean victory or defeat
for other players.
 
~

1 'MAGNETIC THRUST'~
'Magnetic Thrust,' much like 'Sonic Resonance,' allows the casting
Mage to control the nature of space and time in the immediate locale
of his victim.  In this sorcery, the Mage forms a wedge of magnetic
energy within the body of the victim.  As the spell progresses, the
victims organs are violently rent and internal tissues are torn.  The
resulting pain and damage are formidible, indeed.
 
~

0 MAIL~

Syntax: mail write
Syntax: mail subject <string>
Syntax: mail to      <to-list>
Syntax: mail take    <number>
Syntax: mail show
Syntax: mail post
Syntax: mail remove  <number>

The mail command is very similar to the note command.  To write mail, as 
in notes, you must have a blank note held in your hands, and a quill or 
pen in your inventory.  Mail can only be addressed to real players, or 
'all'.  There is a charge for reading and taking mail.
~

65 MAILQUEUE~
Syntax:  mailqueue                         - show current IMC mailqueue

Immortality is finally within your grasp...

~

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...
~

-1 M_GODLVL10_~
You are all powerful!
~

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...


You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...

visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

Syntax: notitle <character>
Syntax: noemote <character>
Syntax: notell  <character>
Syntax: silence <character>
Syntax: unsilence <character>
 
NOTITLE, NOEMOTE, NOTELL, and SILENCE are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from setting their title, emoting, telling, and using
channels, respectively.  Characters who are notelled will also not recieve
those forms of communication.
 
Use UNSILENCE to remove a player's silence.  Simple use notell, noemote or
notitle on the character again to remove each of those restrictions.

53 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>
         oset object on
 
If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

more intelligent than most other races, but their strength and constitution
suffers from their small size.  Because of this, the Pixie often choose the

the Pixie knows no equal.  Pixies possess the obvious ability of flight.

their skin and hair color varies from among all the colors of the rainbow.

1 'QUANTUM SPIKE'~
The 'Quantum Spike' is one of the Sorceror's most awesome attacks.  With
this spell, the casting Mage is able to form, within the body of his
victim, a sphere of Quantum probability optimized in such a way as to
cause the most bizarre contortion of bodily order imaginable.  Organs
and tissues are rendered into unrecognizable blobs interconnected in
fiendish, unknowable geometries.
 
Obviously, such an attack has astonishing effects on any physical
creature, as well as any entity which has an extention into the
physical world.
~

0 QUEST QUESTS~
Certain characters in the game will allow you to go on quests to recover an
item or kill another mob. To go on a quest, you must be in the same room with
a questmaster. When you successfully complete a quest, you will receive a
certain number of quest points. These points may be saved up and used to buy
incredible items from the questmaster.

The QUEST command is used for information about your current quest, to request
a quest from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

QUEST POINTS - Gives your current number of quest points. This command may be
used anywhere.

QUEST INFO - If you are on a quest, this will remind you who or what you are
after.

QUEST TIME - Gives the amount of time remaining on your current quest, or the
amount of time until you can request another quest. This command may be used
anywhere.

QUEST REQUEST - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a quest. If you
accept the quest, you will be given a realtime limit (in minutes) in which you
must complete the quest. If you are on a quest to kill a creature, when you
come across that creature you will see a [TARGET] notice before it. This is
the creature you are to kill.

QUEST COMPLETE - Once you have completed your quest and recovered the item or
killed the mob or whatever, you must return to the questmaster who sent you on
the quest and use this command. If you have successfully completed your quest,
he will reward you with gold and quest points. Once you complete a quest you
cannot request another for 10 minutes.

QUEST LIST - Displays the list of fabulous items for sale by the questmaster.
These items are not buyable via gold, they must be purchased with quest points.

QUEST BUY <item> - Purchases an item from the questmaster and deducts the cost
of the item from your quest points.
~

1 QUESTPOINTS~
Questpoints are awarded as follows:
 
Immortal Run Quests.
    - You can earn up to 50 questpoints by winning an immortal run quest.
      This will reflect in your score if you win (Glory). The prizes are
      as follows. 1st place = 50 qps. 2nd place = 20 qps, and 3rd place
      will get you 10 qps.
 
Roleplaying:
      - If you are awarded roleplayer of the week you will receive 25 qps.
        This may be awarded to more than 1 person per week. It all depends
        on who does a good job. Make your characters come alive, get
        rewarded for it..you can't be that!
 
Here are the prices of what you can use Questpoints for:
 
5000 questpoints = 1 stat raised by 1 permantly.
1000 questpoints = Your own room in the MUD.
 500 questpoints = 1 item from the Quest Item vault. 
 300 questpoints = 500,000 gold.
~

1 QUIT~
Syntax: QUIT
 
QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

~

0 RANGER~
A ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.  A
self-sufficent person, the ranger is adapatable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a ranger is more than skilled enough to defeat most of
his foes.  However, for especially hardy opponents, a ranger also can cast
many useful spells to both hinder his opponent and aid himself.  From minor
curative magics, to calling down lightning from a cloudy sky, the ranger is
the most adept class at surviving on its own.  A ranger typically travels
light, but he does have the mighty strength of a warrior to carry equipment
needed in his travels.  Like the druid (a class he closely resembles), his
need for help from outside sources is low.
 
~

57 RANK~

61 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax:  rassign <character> <begin vnum range> <end vnum range>
 
These commands allow you to assign a range of vnums to an immortal for
so that they may build inside that range.  Use the 'checkvnums' command
before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.
 
Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.

rchannels on its own will show you which IMC channels you have access to, and
whether they are currently on or off.
rchannels with an argument will turn on or off a given IMC channel that you
have access to.
rchannels can also be used to block rtells and rbeeps if necessary.
One additional option is rinvis. rchannels +rinvis will make you totally
invisible to IMC: you cannot be contacted by rtell, rreply, or rbeep, and
you do not appear on rwho. However, you cannot use any IMC channels while
rinvis is active (you can still hear them, though). rchannels -rinvis will
reverse this state.
Immortals may allow you access to IMC channels, or revoke your access to 
them, as necessary.

and will 'restore' every link-live player in the game.  Restore alls such
as this are limited to once every 6 hours, so if one Savior does one,
another cannot do one until 6 hours has passed, regardless of whether or
not they have not done one that day.
 
A Greater God or higher can do a restore all whenever they wish, and are
not constrained by the above limitations.
 
Use 'restoretime' to see when the last restore all was done.
 
See RESTORETIME

0 RULES ~
*********************************************************************
********************** RULES OF THE SHADOW REALMS *******************
*********************************************************************

 1) If you see a bug please use the bug command (see help bug) to
    report it. If you are caught abusing it you will be balzhured.
    (demoted to level 1.) Any other problems should be mailed to
    beowolf@tsr.org 
 
 2) MULTI-PLAYERS ARE NOT TOLERATED HERE. MULTIPLAY is defined as having
    more than one character play the MUD at the same time. If you break
    this rule then first we will warn you and If you contine to do it
    after the warning both of your characters will be deleted.
 
 3) Storage characters will not be allowed.  A storage character is defined 
    as a character that is used to hold eq and not for playing/leveling 
    purposes. If we catch you doing this, there will be no warning. Result
    is the deletion of BOTH your mortal characters.
 
 4) PKILLING (see 'help pkill')

 5) ROLEPLAYING! Remember that this is a Roleplaying MUD. ALL says, gossips,
    and tells will be considered IN CHARACTER UNLESS the player states that
    it is ooc. Remember that this is ONLY a GAME and do not take it 
    those channels to heart. Anything on the OOC channel and OSAY channel
    is considered OUT OF CHARACTER.

 6) OOC CHANNEL - (Out Of Character). This channel was created to give you
    a place where you can talk about REAL LIFE stuff. This includes but is
    not limited to: levels, stats of eq, bugs found in the MUD, ideas to
    improve the MUD, movies, television, etc. Gossip, tells, and says are
    strictly IN CHARACTER unless otherwise noted by the individual.  Failure
    to use the proper channels will result in a warning. If you continue to
    use the wrong channels you will be nochanneled for 1 hour RL time.
 
 7) Swearing and foul language is accepted.  However, if it is spammed over
    the channels, you will be no channeled.  Second offense you will be helled 
    for two real life hours.  The third offense is deletion.

 8) Remember that the immortals spend countless hours trying to make this a 
    great place. Each immortal puts in hundreds of hours a month into the
    MUD to make it great. Please treat every immortal with respect. If you
    talk disrespectivly about an immortal or about the MUD itself over OOC
    you will be first warned. If you continue to do it you will be balzhured
    no questions asked.
 
 9) For rules on sexual harassment type 'help sexual'
 
10) Talking trash will not be tolerated.  Rp'ing is understood and is to be
    kept on the gossip channel.  Nasty 'tells' will result in a warning.
    Demotion and deletion for the next two offenses.
 
12) Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may
    be done so without warning, notice or even evidence of sanity.  Walk softly
    and carry a black stick.

58 RULES DEADLY~
~

1 SACRIFICE~
Syntax:  sacrifice <object>
 
Sacrifice offers an object to the gods, or to your Order or Clan's deity.
The gods may reward you for the sacrifice, and the nature of the reward
depends upon the type of object.
 
Hint: the gods like corpses.
~

0 SAGACITY~
This spell increases your wisdom for its duration.
~

1 SAVE~
Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves one character approximately
minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.
~

60 SAVE IMMORTAL~
~

52 SAVEAREA LOADAREA~
Syntax: savearea
        loadarea

Savearea and loadarea will save or load your prototype area.

After casting the spell, the caster needs only to "look" in the
desired direction.

God or Goddess. They will follow this God or Goddess with great
devotion pledging themselves to help the God or Goddess out. For
many centuries people have followed the Gods and Goddess of the
Realms in hopes to make it a better or worse place. Following 
a sect means responsibility. You will be given special orders

~

57 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

~

0 SEXUAL~
Sexual Harassment on this Mud is not accepted nor will it be tolerated.
Sexual harassment is:
 
1) Using sexual language to someone who doesnt want you speaking to them in
that way.
 
2) Using sexual emotes without permission to do so.  ( french, fondle, etc,)
This does not mean stuff like flirt or stare.
 
Please do not do anything to someone here that you wouldnt do in real life.
As far as I know, frenching and fondling someone you dont know is not
acceptable behavior in any world.  Punishment for harassment ranges from a
warning for the first offense, to deletion, so dont be suprised.  If you have
been sexually harassed, do the following:
 
1) Ask the person to stop.
 
2) Leave the room the person is in.  They cant emote you if you arent ther.
 
3) Tell someone (friend or clan).  Perhaps if your telling them didnt make
them stop, then someone else asking will let them know that you are serious.
 
4) Tell an Immortal what is going on.  Always write a note to an Immortal so
that we know who is doing these things.

carry 500kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons

of armor and clothing, and it is also able to harm opponents one
might think resistant to such attacks, due to its magical nature.

0 THIEF THIEVES~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society.  The skills of the thief reflect his way
of life, namely sneaking in the dark, picking locks, and attacking from
behind with deadly backstabs.  Thieves have always had a bad reputation
so don't be suprised if you are always under suspicion.  Thieves start off
fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and circle they soon
become dangerous foes.  A thief is always usefull when there is a lock
that needs opening or an item that needs to be stolen.
 

~

58 THINK~
Syntax:  think <message>

~

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.

This spell increases your stamina during its duration.
~

57 'TRUE SIGHT'~
Syntax:  cast 'true sight'
 
This spell can only be cast upon yourself.  It is a combination of

and detect hidden.  This spell also allows you to see through
blinding attacks.
~

1 TRUE TRUESIGHT~
Syntax:  cast truesight
Syntax:  c true
 
Truesight confers the caster with a very brief immunity to blindness
(from attacks such as gouge or the blindness spell itself).  While
under the spell's effect, the caster continues to see.  Be warned
that when the spell wears off the caster will become blind should
the effects of the blinding attack still remain.
Truesight cannot be cast on anyone but the caster itself.
~

65 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

~

59 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax: unfoldarea <area filename>

This command will load up an area file.

NOTE: It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already loaded,
      or one that has not been tested.
~

0 UNLUCK~
Example:  cast unluck <victim>
 
With this spell, the wizard creates a negative pattern in the random forces
surrounding one creature.
~

54 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

52 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.
~

0 VALIANCE~
This spell increases your perserverence when you are on the verge of
losing consciousness.
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
Vampires are powerful beings which require copious quantities of fresh blood.
Here is a brief summary of how they compare to the other classes:
 
 - Vampires use blood points (bp) instead of mana for casting spells.
 - Blood points can be lost by taking large amounts of damage during battle.
 - Spare blood points can save a vampire during battle by providing a small
   burst of extra hit points (hp).
 - Vampires get a penalty to armor class during the day, and a bonus during
   the night.
 - Vampires may mist walk to their victims under cover of darkness.
   (help 'mist walk')

0 VENTRILOQUATE~
Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving

your message.

voting with 'note vote <number> open'.  All those who can read the
board may then vote on the issue in the note with 'note vote <number>
yes/no/abstain'. The author may close the voting; the syntax for that
should be clear enough.
 
Note list will show whether a note is not a voting note, open to voting
or closed to voting.  The character that separates the author and the
recipient in 'note list' will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.
~

58 VSEARCH~
Syntax:  vsearch <vnum of target object>
 
Returns all instances of the target object presently in the game, as
well as their level.  Allows location of objects via vnum instead of
by keyword, useful for locating rekeyed and renamed objects.
 
See OWHERE
~

2 WAR WARTALK~
Syntax:  war <message>
 
Wartalk is a channel created as a haven for those players who like to openly
discuss their exploits in combat - and brag against their opponents.  It is
most often used for those who declare war on other deadlies and is desirable
for those who like to invite others to battles in player versus player
whether it be in the arena or around the Realms.
 
Wartalk can be seen by all players in the game, and has the same
rules as other channels.  No harassment, profanity, spamming, or
inappropriate subject matter.

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warrior are the epitome of fighters, able to use all weapons and armours in
excercise of their most lethal of combat skills.  A warrior must be strong

1 WIPE~
. NOTICE: We are sorry to report but we have had our first and our last
  player file wipe. This was due to the fact that we found about 50% of
  our OLD Mobs had a serious level bug. We were not sure how many people
  abused this bug so we did the only thing we could in all fairness and
  decided to have the wipe. Hence the reason that the MUD has been down
  for a week. We have completely redone ALL the Mobs in the MUD. Thank
  you for your patience and understanding.
