scottish fugitive~
scottish fugitive~
The fugitive is quietly making his way to a hide-out.
~
Though a hero to his kinfolk and bairns, this quiet man has somehow
violated English law making it necessary for him to seek refuge where the
law will not find him easily.  He carries very little with him and you
wonder where he manages to get supplies.

Sir William Wallace the Bravehearted~
Sir William Wallace thunders the stirring battlecry, "FREEDOM!!"
~
Blue eyes ablaze with indomitable charisma and bravery, this larger than
life legend among men, Braveheart stands his ground as ye enter the room. 
His long chestnut hair has several small braids on each side of his face
while the rest streams over his shoulders tossed by the winds.  Braw to look
at, his face is partly covered with a jagged design of intense sky-blue
warpaint.  His broad shoulders amply support the tartan flung o'er one
shoulder and the scabbard on the other.  Beneath those are his studded
leather shirt and belt.  A handsome looking kilt is worn aboot his waist. 
His smile is from the angels themselves.

Bonnie Banks O' Loch Lomond~
The surrounding upward slopes known as braes are green and the muirs that
some call moors are carpeted lushly with heather.  The wild cry of the loon
echoes a wistful refrain strangely out of keeping in this peaceful scene. 
Thither and yon you see a hale gilly-fish ripple the cobalt waters of this
pristine very deep loch.  In the distance you hear the poignant strains of
the bagpipes.  Near the banks you see the ghosts of a braw warrior and his
lass wrapped in the arms of true luve.  'Tis said he was brought here via
the Low Road at the speed of Death.

Path Towards Outer Banks~
You brush aside the shrub-elder branches as you head deeper towards the
less explored reaches of Loch Lomond's outerbanks.  Bluebells of a richer
hue than the sky itself bloom in sequestered clumps along the way.  To one
side you see a dense thicket patch.  Something or someone has startled the
brown hare who almost hops right on your feet as it dashes by you.  The path
east has been declared off limits temporarily but a sign advises it will be
opened later.

Opening to Rebel Cave~
The cave entrance is low enough that ye need to to stoop slightly as ye
enter.  To one side of the entrance the embers from a small fire still glow
dimly.  Aromatic yew branches are piled on the other side covering a neat
pile of what look like hare or rabbit bones.  It appears the Picts may have
left a few things around.

Rebel Room~
The thundering braw words of a rebel echo magically through this room. 
Behind my rock I hide, my friends seem few.  The sun goes down upon the
darkening plain.  Those who have dispossessed me congregate.  I may not see
the sun go down again.  I am the rebel, though my cause seems lost, yet will
I fight and fight again.  I will encounter death before submission to these
proud conquerors on the darkening plain.

Cairn Tunnel~
As you wander farther into the cave you almost stumble on a neatly piled
stack of rocks known as a cairn.  The ground is a wee bit damper here and
the distant sounds of an underground stream pique your curiosity.  Someone
has left a large metal horse-shoe to the side of the cairn.  Perhaps ye
might want to look at it more closely.

horseshoe~
In Scotland, the horse-shoe is not so much a bringer of luck as a
keeper-away of evil.  And here is how it obtained the power to keep off
witches, bogles and all other imps of the Devil.  Once upon a time, the
Devil pulled from his bed at midnight a smith in Lochaber, for badly his
hooves needing shoeing.  The smith, annoyed and frightened, but having the
Devil in his power, not only burned the horn of the hoof he was shoeing, but
the fleshy part, too!  While driving in the first nail, the smith
deliberately hammered it into the flesh.  The Devil screamed in agony, and
hpped round the smithy on one unshod foot.  He howled for the man to tear
out the nail and to shoe him properly, but the smith refused until the Devil
was willing to promise him anything.  And the promise the man extracted was,
that wherever a horse-shoe lay or hung no evil thing could pass.  And the
Devil, perforce, had to agree.

Cairn Crossroads~
The ceiling in this part of the cave is festooned with shimmering
crystalline snowball-like formations.  Neatly stacked cairns are beside the
exits though their meaning is unclear to you right now.  You see some words
of a famous Scottish proverb chisled in the wall.  One cairn or pile of
rocks looks especially interesting.

The sounds of rushing water become louder as you enter this section of
the tunnel.  Even the air in here is slightly misty and some club moss is
sprouting on the earth floor close to the cavern walls.  Something swoops by
your head and you duck instinctively hoping that it was only a bat.

BraveHeart's Linn~
A silver linn of icy-cold fresh spring water cascades over the step-stone
roughened side of the cavern.  The misty spray from the linn touches your
face causing you to shiver slightly.  Some of the water forms a wee pool in
a naturally made trough.  The rest of it rushes off via a very small opening
at the far cave wall.  It doesn't look as if a man could fit through that
opening.  This part of the cave ends abruptly here.

The cavern walls here have a slight amethyst hue.  You smell the faint

ale?  Most Scottish bairns or children have heard the story of the heather
ale and how it started with the Pechs or as some say, Picts.

Heather Tunnel~
As ye travel down this tunnel a verra fine aroma fills the air.  Chisled
in the slightly amethyst glowing wall ye see: 
From the bonny bells of heather,
They brewed a drink langsyne,
Was sweeter far than honey,
Was stronger far than wine.

You enter a roomy gathering area that looks as if much partying and
celebrating has taken place frequently.  There is a warm fire crackling in
the ingle or fireplace and you see a plate of black buns, studded with
fruits and nuts, sitting on a nearby table.  Shelves with mugs line one of
the cavern walls.  A bonnie set of bagpipes rests carefully in one corner. 
The pechs in this room certainly seem to be cheerful.

The Prince gazes at you calmly as he swigs down some of the heather ale.  He
rises from his gilded throne chair of heather colored velvet.  "Tis a
secret, I ken but I maun not tell ye", he says with a slight slur to his

Fugitive's Hideout~
Where you confront your foes, I now turn and have to flee.
I am too weak to make heroic stand.
My hope is to escape, and so I slip
From cave to cave across the darkening land.
 
No one will tell of my heroic death
My strategy is to delude and live.
When Fortune smiles again, I will return
And rule again, I am the fugitive.

There is an air of mystery in this part of the hideout.  Dark green
sprays of juniper bearing silvery berries are placed to one side.  A stack
of barley bannocks known as flat bread are heaped on a cog which is a wooden
plate set in a nook.  Several medium sized boulders cover parts of the

Thistle Lair~
You quietly climb down the rough-hewn ladder and gratefully land with a
soft thump.  The quiet seclusion and semi-darkness in here gives a feeling
of safeness which hopefully is not just an illusion.  A number of open
crates, filled with supplies, are stacked around the cave room.  In one
crate you see extra dirks and fresh quivers of arrows.  Another crate bears
waterskins, cloth bandages and medicinal herbs.  Salted fish, dried nuts and
fruits as well as oatcakes are in a third crate.  Upon closer inspection you
find what appears to be a sleeping area nestled behind some of the crates. 
There is even a tartan blanket spread out to keep a body warm.  How would a
hunted fugitive escape if this lair was invaded?

are also several bottle of guid whiskey setting there.  The words of a

with a considerable number of the enemy.  Several large Scottish deerhounds

Shaped like a natural horseshoe, there is a heavily wooded deep gully
running through the middle of this area.  It is sort of a minature glen down
which tumbles a cool, refreshing burn or stream.  Hares run through the wild
myrtle and ferns growing along this gully.  The wind ripples through the red
hawthorne trees and sweeps past the pines and the yews.  The air is perfumed
by gowans, gillyflowers, pink azaleas and bluebells.  Hills surround three
sides of the horseshoe.  If there is an exit out it is so well hidden ye

A scent of gowens or mountain daisies freshens the air here and ye notice
off to one side of this irregularly shaped area is an opening in the cavern
which is well guarded by some of the clanmen.  Here before ye is the living
legend that Scots have bled with in the battlefields be they highlanders or
lowlanders.  Doon by yer feet ye spy a stack of long sharpened poles which
Braveheart and his men used so advantageously at the battle of Stirling
Ridge.  Ye can see the tips of them are still stained with blude.  Wallace
radiates an aura of courage and charmisma and indomitable will that ye
rarely see amongst mortal men.
