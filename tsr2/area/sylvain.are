The Sunlit Forest~
You travel along at an easy pace.  Many game trails and little
undergrowth make for pleasant travelling.  The sky that you glimse through
the trees is remarkably blue and the sunlight shining through the leaves
shades everything with soft green.  However to your north the shadows look
darker and the paths are few.

There are no real paths here and it would be easy to get lost if you are
not careful.  At least the underbrush is not very thick.  It is nice and
warm under the tree and everything has a healthy green glow.  In the trees
the chirping birds make a nice relaxing melody.

The underbrush is thick and tall making it very hard to travel in a
straight line.  A path through the underbrush leads to the south where it
seems more open.  The air is hot and humid, causing you to perspire. 
Looking up you notice that there are many openings in the foliage, allowing
the underbrush to grow tall.

you.

dampness and decay of a swamp.

stunted tree yet.  From the west comes a gentle breeze and you can imagine
hands trying to push you away.

underbrush and looks to be hard going while the path east looks open and
inviting.

of all you see.  The Red and green of the tamarack.  The patch of blue sky. 
The forest is sloping gently downwards towards the west.

The light does not seem so bright anymore.  There are still flashes of
light as the trees sway in the breeze.  Tamaracks are much more common now
and the ground has become a little boggy.  You shiver a little as a bit of
mist swirls about your feet.  The caw of a crow seems to echo mournfully
among the trees.  To the west you hear the gentle murmur of the river.

path you are following crosses a wider trail going north and south.

sunlight to the west seems to draw you.  At least it is dry under the heavy

A gate is carved into a large redwood tree.  The trunk is lost in the
canopy of the other trees.  The gate is large and solid.  It looks like it
has not been opened in years.  Many dead orange needles surround the base of
the trunk.  The needles look completely undisturbed, except by occasional
breezes.

Small Path~
You can hardly call this a path, more a rabbit run.  Although the trees
press close together, you can still catch glimses of houses and elves going
about daily life.  The back curves ever so gently around and eventually it
is heading east.  A gentle breeze cools you and you can almost make out
words in it.

The small path weaves and winds through the tall smooth trees.  A layer

ahead.  You feel a vague chill from the south.  To the west you faintly hear
music.  The breeze carries the faint sound of laughter from the east.

Finally a break in the forest!  It sems like ages since you have seen the

by tiny mushrooms.  Could it be a faerie glade of legend?  You notice a
flash of white disappearing into the forest on the north side of the glade.

The trees appear very solemn.  Even the wind has stopped.  The only noise
you hear is your own breathing.  To the north you glimse more of the
straight silver trees.  To the south of you are tall spreading oak trees. 
You can sense a bit of tension in the area.  As if each type of tree was
watching the other.

laughter as a leaf travels down the stream.  The forest is more open here
letting light shine down on the brook, as a result a wide variety of flowers
and grasses grow along its banks.

As you wind your way among the trees, firs become more common.  Suppenly
