A Shallow Reef~
You are standing in a couple of feet of water. Small waves lap
at your knees, the cool water soothing on a hot day. The walk 
out here was nice, but the reef seems to end here. As you look
down into the water, you notice a steep drop off.

your feet, as the currents toss you about.  The ocean bottom continues in

rocks are very sharp, and tear at your footgear.  To your west is what
appears to be a cave dug out of the rock face.  The ocean continues to the
north and east.

would send you off into oblivion, or up against the rock face.

A sunken pirate ship!  As your feet touch the bow of the ship you notice
that the figurehead on the front of the ship has been removed, and now rests
on the deck.  It's not a pretty sight either.  It's very down this deep, and
hard to see anything, but you see shapes moving about the middeck of the
ship.

Mid Ship~
You stand near the middle of the ship. At your feet is the 
cargo hold hatch. You bend down to try and open it , but find
that it has rusted shut. To the west you glimpse a shadow that
thrusts up towards the surface.

Main Mast~
The main mast of this ancient ship towers above you. Measuring
nearly ten feet in diameter, the tree it was formed from have
been awesome to behold. The ropes that lead to the crow nest and
rigging have been long since deteriorated, but swimming to the top
should not be a problem.

room, there is no water at the bay at door's threshold.  The room is very
spacious and most likely the second largest room on the ship.  A large bed
is against the port wall is a large cabinet, its doors glowing a bright
blue.  On the desk is an open log book.
