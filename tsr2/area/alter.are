The top of a narrow tunnel~
This tunnel is very narrow It is only wide enough for one person to pass
at a time.  Your shoulders are rubbing the sides of it as you shimmie down. 
The smell of cold earth is strong in your nose.  Roots are poking through
the walls of the passage, making it even harder for you to pass through this
narrow slip of a passage.

The walls of the tunnel are opening up slightly.  Peering down below you,
you can see what appears to be a large opening of sorts.  The roots in the
walls of the passage are lessening in number making it easier to move.  The
smell of the earth is getting stronger.

designs of a great battle.  The archway directly in front of you is also

There are many hints to who it belongs to, one is the cigar butt's left

magical hook floating in mid-air this room is most definatly Garison's.
There is also a magical portal that leads to the Chamber of Garison,
but alas there is a sign that reads "Temperarly Out Of Order". Hehheheheheheh.
