I have tried and as well as others to seek our goals without the
hatred and pain that comes along with it. To seek those only that attack
us first, but in the meantime we all have lost the meaning of why
we came together as a family. And that is to stop all the ruins by
evil do ers in the realms.. through any means possible. HENCE
we will no longer stand in the shadows and sit idly by while they attack
we must stand once and for all for what we believe in. UNITED AS ONE
we can erradicate those who wish harm upon the realms.
SEEK those who wish the ruins of the realms and teach them what the
REBELLION is truly made of.. of strength, will, and the belief
that we can stop that which we stand up against.

To my Rebellions brothers and sisters and to my Lady Bryelle,
 
I would like to say that I am very honored to be once again serving you
as a sect leader, and I think that Garog will make an excellant leader
as well.  I know that I haven't been around much lately, so I think that
it would be best for me to explain myself for the benefit of everyone here
Firstly, I would like to say that my style of leadership is not quite
the same as many of you around here are used to.  I do not say much...in
fact, it is rare that I speak out at all...but when I do, I mean every
word I say...my word is my bond...and there is nothing truer than my word
save for my blade...I would do anything for anyone of you...and if you need
me, all you need do is ask and it shall be done...that is my mission, to
help all of you that that you, in turn, may help me in achieving the 
greater cause for the Rebellion and Bryelle.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this and know that I am here...you
may not be able to see me or hear me...but I am there...in the shadows...
where your mind says no, but your heart says yes.
 
With deepest regards, I am
Qmtarr Del'Shai, defender of the broken hearted

Since only a few voted i chose the last entry for the 2nd in command
Which should have been Qmtarr with Krast as 1st command, for the
mistake I apologize it was a mess up in my typing.
If all of you wish to revote again that is fine by me, but make sure
that all vote.. the sect needed leaders and few voted so i chose
what I thought would be best. Those changes have been made accordingly
forgive for my mistake.

Ok i will like to say one thing ... I know that you cant always expect
people to get along together but you have to try for the sake of the
Sect. OOC: Remember as well this is just a GAME.
 
If you have any problems with another member of the sect come to me
about the problems and do not discuss it to anyone else.. I DO NOT
WANT ANYONE talking bad about their sect members whether what they
are saying is right or wrong. I catch anyone doing it you will get two
warnings.. third time will call for dismissal.
 
Any PROBLEMS COME TO ME.

Time is coming closer, where all that we know will be put to test
It is time where we must stick closer together than ever... to
trust each other and put our lives in each others hands.
All past must be forgotten and the future to come must be paid attention
to. 
 
We are in the AGE of CHAOS and before anything gets better, they will
get worse. I forsee pain stretching throughout the lands and the 
forces of evildoers gaining numbers and in strength. WE must be prepared
for what is to come. DEPEND on each other for support.
 
I shall be with you always. NEVER FORGET THAT.
and NEVER FORGET what we have all come together to accomplish!

My Family:
  I would like to state that, as some of you know, I was attacked,while
half-dead from another battle, and with a damaged weapon, by surprise, by the C
Krast came to my aid, and defeated Felcar.  Later Krast defeated him again.
I then did so.  this, I beleive, shows well that which we already knew...
CHAOS IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED.
as you have probably seen, we posted Felcar's head on a pike just inside of Dar
as a warning to others who would test our loyalty
.
                    sincerely,
                            Brimthron, Son of Lifestone, Axeman of Rebellion
