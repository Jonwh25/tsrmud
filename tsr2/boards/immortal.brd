For anyone who wishes to know how to use the olc spell creation thingy, and
can create them, just ask me whenever you wish and I can run through all the
basics of it real quick.
 
Spells I have created thus far:
 
Necromancy spells:  Rotting bones, bone to steel, and asphyxiate.
 
Psionic spells:  Clairvoyance, combat mind, soften, and energy containment.
 
Many more spells to come for both classes and most help files are available
for these.  Throw suggestions my way, as I am eager to create more.
