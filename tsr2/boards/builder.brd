The following is a list of all the values you set. 
.
hitroll, armor, hitnodice, hitsizedice, hitplus, damnnodice, damroll
 
Set all of these to 0. (0d0+0) because TSRII will auto-generate these
values for us. that way we don't have to worry about balance problems.
Thanks,
Beowolf

Ok...more info....For objs....set any item type that is type weapon
values 1 and 2 (v1 + v2) to 0. These  will be autogenerated based
on the weapons level. You may have only 5 weapons max that are your
own v1 and v2 values.
 
Now a word on dig.
------------------
You have to set the exflag (see help exflags) to CLOSED and DIG.
The following sector types will not allow digging to work:
city, inside, swim, noswim, underwater, and air.
Also to dig successfully the player must have a shovel. (ITEM_SHOVEL)
That sould do it.

Ok...first I know how redit on, mset on, and whatever else is nice but
it seems to be crashing the mud. I dunno why or how yet, but all the
logs indicate that usually the only time the mud crashes is when one
of those editors is in the on position. So do your best to try to just
build without turning it on. Also I have some news concerning mobs. heh.
You can leave the following parts of the mob OUT when making a mob due
to the mud setting the default values for you:
 
hitroll, damroll, armor, hp, mana, move, practice.
 
That way you don't have to worry about numbers...only takes about 4 mins
per mob if that...
Take care,
Beowolf

Greetings Builders, You will now need to build on port 8002 from now
on. You may log on here when you want, but please do not build on
ports 8000 or 8001 anymore. Thank you for your time and your hard
work with your areas. Take care,

Greetings,
The entrance to the 36 chambers of the lotus needs to be changed.
It appears that there are one way doors into the chamber.  So the mobs
wander in and can't get out.
 Which brings up the other topic, I am not sure if nowander flag
for mobs works.  Does anyone know for sure?
Thanks, Terram

As far as I know...nowander means the mob will not wander UNLESS
it is attacked.  So if someone attacks it and runs, it is free to
wander in the area.  Just my thoughts.
