Greetings Admins, 
 
Payment for the MUD is set up as follows. Kilmar has stopped paying for
the site as well as Thallin I guess since I never got payment from him.
Here is the current people paying for the site:
 
Beowolf, Variant, Remik. 
 
Short list. Here is how much money I've lost and by who since we started
here:
 
Nemesis (remember her?) $65
Thallin $25
Grand Total I've lost: $90
 
Now, Remik has agreed to make up for Thallin. So I guess I've lost $65 but in
fact that was made up for by a donation from Taltos at christmas time. So 
all in all this is just a finacial report. As far as now..the new payment
will be due June 1st. With 3 people right now that is a total of $45 due then.
 
Thanks. 
Beowolf
