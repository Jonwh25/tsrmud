Changes have been made, once again to the sect castle.
 
New eq and sect weapons have been added.  Level 10 is the basic level of use
they are good for.  Ave dam on weapons is level 10 and the armor on the
eq is -10.  Use em.  Took me damned near forever to create the shit.

The Rebellion is getting out of hand.  Bryelle obviously has a way with words
when it comes to newbies and we need to set the record straight.  Not only do
I want to kill the fucks for who they are and what they stand for, we need to
teach these kids to how to roleplay and shit.  How much fun are we missing 
from the old days?  Lots?  I know its not as much fun as it used to be..
the constand bashing and raving of Cepheid, Vader, Sirian, Mantra, Slither (Ha!
), Variant, and MANY others, was just soo much fun.  These people had half a
brain when it came to this shit.  They knew how to make it fun and blah.
Part of the problem IS, is that Variant has yet to produce a new plot for us,
but it isnt his fault, he's busy with the mythos and RL shit.  He promised me
a new one in weeks.  
 
Back to Rebellion.  It will be soo much fun (IMHO) to taunt them and drag their
sorry asses into Rp'ing and fucking them over.  We need to start shit and make
this fun.  Currently the Imms are tinking of ways we can all do this.. and 
with the return of Thallin, you know things are about to pick up. So.. lets do
each other a favor and put an end to the Rebellion. ;>
