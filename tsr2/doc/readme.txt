I admit it... most of the SMAUG code is very poorly documented.
This is because most of the effort was spent on coding, and very little
on documenting.

I have gone over all the text files in this directory, and done my best
to update them in my spare time.

Due to the ability to edit most everything online, you will most likely
find the online help pages more informative.

(You should find WIZHELP, HELP and HLIST very useful)
