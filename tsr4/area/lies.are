Graveyard~
The smell of autumn fills the air.  Leaves, touching all colors of the
spectrum fill view.  A small, worn picket fence has been assembled in 
a rectangle shape, focusing attention to what lies inside:  A graveyard.
Graves, monuments, tombs, all on display.  Some reach higher than ten
feet tall while others strive to make it past one foot.  The gray of the
cemetary contrasts greatly with the changing of the seasons, making the
sight all the more grand.  Slowly, the image that is seen is broken.
Cracks of black void reach out and destroy the picture that was once here.

Entrance to the Tower~
The black void again cracks, this time forming an area much different than
the autumned season that last appeared.  Where there were tombs and graves
before now lie bones and corpses.  Reaching out of your view is a giant, black
colossus of Remik.  This doom-impending tower stands over two hundred feet 
tall and fourth as wide.  Remik, clad in a corpse colored cloak, stands admist
a great battlefield, torn with death.  A large stone door in Remiks left leg
can be made out.  A possible entrance, you would imagine.

The Base of the Tower~
The base of the colossus reveals the material that the outside of the tower
is made from.  A very hard, black stone.  The stone itself looks very polished
and gleams brightly from the slightest of light.  The stone door in the left
leg of the tower is stands slightly taller than ten feet, and half that in
width.  A very large carving has been placed into the door, and even from the
untrained eye, it can be recognized as the insignia of Deception.  From here,
the only other exit other than into the colossus is back south, further away
from the tower of Remik.

Main Hall~
Stepping through the door, it can be noted that the dimensions on the outside
do not reflect the dimensions on the inside.  Outside, the colossus seemed 
rather large, however, on the inside, it seems much bigger.  This single room
must be well over five times its actual size on the outside.  Roughly the room
itself seems about one hundred by one hundred square feet.  This magical room
may seem rather dull in color, but does not lack in description.  All colors
conform to a grayscale:  The walls and floor being of a black color dotted with
various shades of gray.  The walls however, do not draw attention because of
their color.  They draw attention from the fact that they seem alive.  Spinless
bodies, mutilated parts, and bones pile on top of each other to form the walls
and floor of the House of Lies.  The figures stand still, but look have a look
of desperation and need.  They look as if they are trying to escape but have
been damned for eternity by being buried here.  An open passage to the east
and west trail off from here, as well as a staircase to the north.

Clerical Hall~
The smooth black stone that was evident in the former room snakes its way into
here.  The colors of the polished stone change, however.  As if in some form
of transformation, the black stone with gray dots conform to a new pattern of
dark red stone with yellow spots.  In the center of the room, an alter stands,
erecting itself over ten feet in height, near half the distance to the ceiling.
A rather ornate looking statue stands before the alter, as if looking down 
upon it.  The statue, recognized as Dalos, was Remiks father before Beowolf
had slain him.  The grand nature of the room almost forces anyone who walks in
to bow their head in homage.  The only exit from here is west.

Altar to Remik~
A rather large altar to Remik stands in the center of the room.  The altar,
a shade of corpse blue, stands out well against the black and red stone of the
House.  The altar, constucted to shape the true form of Remik, shows off the 
newly scarred flesh of his brand:  an infinity sign.  Remik, standing more
than fifteen feet in height, is wraped in a shroud of death.  Spirits, shadows,
and phantasmal figures swirl around his body, making one smooth spiral about 
his cloaked figure.  The figures in the wall seem even more disturbed in this
room than in the Main Hall.  The only exit from here is east.

Stairs~
A very steep set of stairs make their way up the leg of the colossus. Hundreds
of stairs make almost a vertical climb to the next level.  They sheer height
and space of the stairs make the staircase seem forever.  The smooth black 
stone of the walls make the stairs rather dark, bringing a horrible detail to
attention.  Screaming.  All about, coming from the walls, and the stairs as
feet step upon them, horrific cries of pain wail in your ears.  Up and down
seem to be the only exits from here.

This level, much like the Main Hall, has black stone walls, and floor. 
Polished and gleaming the smallest detail, the writing bodies contained within
wail in pain, asking to be freed, as they reach for your body.  The floor,
no longer very stable, has taken upon some rather odd dimensions.  It rises and
falls, as if breathing, making several spots very unstable.  From this hellish
room, exits lead down, east, west, and up.

Cloaked Magic~
Upon entering this room, a glowing ball of light appears.  The room, formerly
black, shines with an evil aura.  The light, changing its radiation and color
every blink, flickers on and off, revealing the contents of the room.  A
shopkeeper, cloaked in silence, stands near the back of the room, sweeping his
arms to his sides, displaying in full all that he has to offer.  He motions
with a single finger the individual items he has for sale right now.  The only
exit from here is to the west.

Cloaked Tools~
This room, much like many of the others, has walls made of a hard stone, 
writhing and wiggling with bodies of those fallen before Remik and the Old
Deception.  However, towards the back of the room, the floor rises at a ninety
degree angle, creating a wall five feet high.  It continues back and looks much
like the counter of a shopkeepers den.  Behind the counter, a large beholder
hovers. Its tenticals and seven or eight eyes look at nothing but you, almost
looking past you, as if they can see into your soul.  Something looks to have
been scratched on to the wall to the right, next to the only exit leading east.

Stairs~
Again, very steep steps make their way up and down the torso of the colossus.
The stairs seem hundreds in pair, doubling again when you reach the top.  Even
though your feet are hitting stone, cries of pain burst your eardrums.  Outside
of the wailing, nothing can be heard.  What makes it worse are the close walls,
making the experience three times as loud.

Third Level~
Upon entering the third level of the House of Lies, the hollow screaming that
could once be heard has stopped.  Instead, a dead silence has taken its place,
as a mist of black fog rises from the floor.  No longer do the walls contain 
lifeless bodies of the dead, but now contain plain black stone.  A room to the
east and west exit from here, as well as another staircase leading upward.

Portal Room~
Char black stone covers the entire room.  From head to toe, you see nothing
but the black soot of ashes.  A single figure stands in the pile of soot.
He does no move or speak.  He only performs the bidding of you, a Deception
Master.  This creature is said to be a creation made by Remik himself, in an
attempt to replicate life.  This experiment gone wrong now fulfills his master
by transporting his followers to their choice of destination.

Body Parts~
The third level hall pales in comparison to this room when it comes to an evil
design.  The walls, floor, and shopkeepers counter all contain the fresh blood
and bones of victims.  A million screams doubling over again and again cry out
to listening ears.  On top of the counter, munching on a soldiers arm, is a 
lich.  His empty eye sockets fix on you briefly, before he continues his lunch.

Stairs~
It is a short climb to the top, and a short dive to the bottom of this set of
stairs.  The black luster of the stairway gleams, as you can see shadow
creatures passing in, over, and under you.  Looking either way, you can see
nothing on either end of the staircase, as both are pitch black.  Near the top
of the stairs, however, a powerful humming noise can be heard.

Throne of Remik~
You stand in the center of a dark room with stale air.  Torches light all that
you see.  In the back, center, sits a tall, elegant throne.  Torchlight dances
and flares off of the carved, gold gargoyles, snakes, and shadow beings that
cover every inch of this statley structure.  A canopy draped with heavy red
brocade and trimmed with gold tassels is jutting overhead.  The throne itself
is sitting atop three square, white marble platforms that serve as steps.  The
whole thing is massive and imposing.  Tufted blue velvet cover the seat, the
back, and tops the arms.  The room, taking on the motif from the second level,
boasts death and dying in the walls and floor.  While on the second level the
bodies were still and inanimate, this floor, however, has motion, as well as
live screams.  A sick and uneasy feeling comes to mind when seeing all of
this.  The only exit from here is down.

Dead Knowledge~
Before entering this room, it appeared as black as night.  The second a foot
had touched the perimiters of the room, it lit up.  As clear as day, the room
that now stands in your vision is much like a dream.  The walls and floor are
much like the rest of the House, but floating about the room are the spirits
of former Deception members.  They welcome you with a quick salute and a grin.
The spirits float all about, touching and spinning at the sight of you.  In
front of you, and the main point of this room is a radiating wall of light.
Your mind booms with a terrible voice, as you know this is where you can learn
the skills and spells of those before you.

Upon entering this room, you nearly fall into a large, black void of fog.
The void looks to hold an unlimited amount of space.  Inside you can see
various things, floating atop the pit, waiting to be taken.  The only exit from
here is north, in the the third level hall.
