Corner of Monet and Chillington Way~
Here Monet meets with Chillington Way in a cascade of greens and yellows.  This
intersection almost seems to glow.  The buildings here seem to also reflect
the brightness of the roads.  Being built of white type stones.  On the sides
of the roads there are spaces that only water run through.  The houses just
seem to float along here, and the only entrance to any of them are through
planks.  North is Chillington Way, and back east continues Monet.

Monet Street~
The only people along Monet now head east towards the Art Gallery.  Its a
wonder that so many are around the building itself.  The road is still green,
as the sun glints off blindingly.  Every once in awhile you hear an
undistinguishable scream from the west.  Monet continues west and east from
here.

Monet Street~
The street here is crowded with people heading in and out of the store to the
north.  A sign above the store reads, "Art Gallery of Waters Gate".  The
building is desinged in different colors of the same bricks used on the roads.
Giving the structure a definite detached look.  The road from here continues
east and west along Monet.

Monet Street~
Just as deserted as the rest of Monet, the stones just aren't as welcoming.
Noises drift in from the east where people are standing about.  The air here
is somewhat thicker with the smell of paint.  Rushing past you is a young man
with an easle and canvas straped across his back.  There are only two ways to
go from here.  To the west, where people clammer around a small building, and
back east towards Waters Gate Road.

Monet Street~
The bricks along this road are a sickly green.  The buildings don't look as
they have been measured to an equality as the other streets do.  The people
along the street all carry packs across their backs, and a few with brushes
at their sides.  The wind seems to howl a little more when walking down this
street.  The road continues west down Monet, and back east towards the Waters
Gate Road.

Waters Gate Road and Monet Street~
The green stones of Monet and the white of Waters Gate does not make such
an idealic setting.  Very few people travel this road, and all seem to be
sceptical of the others around them.  The buildings down Monet seem darker and
somewhat more sinister than the ones percieved down the other roads.  From this
point one has the choice of going down Monet or to continue north along Waters
Gate.

Main Street~
The ditches along the road are now full of water, and barely any land can be
seen.  The road has not changed from the light blue bricks.  People still crowd
the streets, playing music and games.  Every so often you see a person carrying
a net attached to a pole walk along one of the ditches.  Main Street continues
west to Lanton Lane.  It also goes east back to what seems to be a large party.

In front of the Green Lizard~
It is just as loud here as it was at the square dance.  People seem to crowd
around the entrance to the north.  There is a sign that hangs outside the
building marking it as the Green Lizard Pub.  A strange name for a pub, but
the people here sure don't seem to mind it.  The road seems to be getting
softer along here, and ditches have been started between the road and the
houses.

Main Street~
Along this portion of Main Street people are streeming lanterns together.
They are setting up post and blocking off a square.  Some carpenters build what
looks to be a makeshift stage to the north.  A band of musicians sit off to the
right playing different types of music.  Children and parents alike dance in
groups or in a couple.  To the west continues Main Street, and to the east is
Waters Gate Road.

Main Street~
Music hangs in the air like a thick fog.  Laughter and screams of children
playing come from all around.  A couple by the corner of a house to the north
kiss with no apparent worries.  Guards walk the streets with smiles more than
the serious pace that is commonly associated with them.  To the west is seems
to be more of the same, and east is Waters Gate Road.

Waters Gate Road and Main Street~
The intersection of Main Street and Waters Gate Road is filled with traffic.  
Children run around having mock wars with each other.  Their parents off to
the side under some shade talking with friends and family.  The people of 
Waters Gate seem to have no worries.  The bricks color for Main Street is a
light blue.  Perhaps this has something to do with the mood of the people here?
As with the other streets of Waters Gate, the two roads join here making
a spiral pattern.  From here one can go west down Main Street, or continue
on Waters Gate Road.

Waters Gate Road and Cherry Street~
Coming to the intersection of Cherry and Waters Gate brings another unusual
surprise to the craftmanship put into every stone.  The stones from Cherry 
street are red, and the white ivory of Waters Gate road produce an unknown
beauty.  The colored stones make a swirling pattern, meeting in the middle.
From this vantage point you can continue on Waters Gate road, or go west
down Cherry street.

Waters Gate Road and Convoy Street~
Convoy Street and Waters Gate Road meet every standard of what the road should
look like.  Convoy street, covered with golden bricks is laid just as well as
any other.  The cost and time it took must have been horendous to the city.
The only difference besides color in the Convoy street bricks is a sigil that
seems litteraly part of the rock itself.  It shows a pirate and a serpent in
them.  People rush along, barely seeming to notice the bricks as they have been
around well befor themselves.  There are no structure down Convoy Street.
Just Merchants selling their wares, and caravans making their way to Waters
Gate Center.  From there is access to the Floating Merchants, and the pier to
ship their goods around the world.

Western Monet Street~
Comming this far down Monet shows the road in a different aspect.  The road,
wich seems to be floating on top of water is a little more busy down here. 
Mainly with children playing in the water.  Every once in awhile you here a
scream come from the parents of the children to clear the water for a minute.
The only guess to why they would do that is perhaps the serpents depicted in
the gates.  Further west one can see the intersection of a short alley and
monet, and east monet meets Lanton Lane.

Waters Gate Road North~
This portion of Waters Gate road is the same as the others.  Its white ivory
bricks layed out perfectly.  The sun, when rising or setting, turns the stones
a gold color.  It is no longer a mystery of why Waters Gate has untold riches.
There is more activity on this path heading north to Convoy.  People carrying
packages of all descriptions and sizes seem to be making there way there.

Entrance of Waters Gate~
The road here is made of an ivory looking stone.  Each stone is perfectly
placed adjacant to every other stone.  It must have taken a long time to lay
the stones perfectly.  There are only three ways you can go from here.  There
there is the gate from wich all travelers seemingly enter this city.  To the
north and south is Waters Gate road.

Waters Gate Road~
Here the ivory colored stone is the same as befor.  Methodicaly placed, and
perfectly shaped to be a replica of the others.  There seems to be less traffic
to this section of the road.  Seemingly the more important roads are to the
north.  From here though, one can go south to the intersection of Monet and
Waters Gate.

Befor a Large Gate~
The trail you have taken ends here befor a large set of ivory gates.  The
ivory seems to shed some soft white light.  There is some large writing carved
into the top of the gate, reading Waters Gate.  Also carved within the ivory
gates are what looks to be snakes of some kind fighting humanoid figures.  It
must be depicting the land as it was befor it turned into the city of Waters
gate.

Art Gallery of Waters Gate~
Now one sees why people very rarely frequent this part of town.  Waters Gate
a city built on trade and pirates look down upon artists.  This is the one
place in the town one might find art.  There are more people here than in the
streets.  Seems this is not merely a gallery, but also a place to rest and
grab a quick cup of coffe befor going back out in the elements.

The Green Lizard~
Entering a crowded pub is one things, but this place is much bigger than it
looked from the outside.  The bar lines the western wall, and there are more
places to sit than what the building looks it can hold.  On all the walls there
are pictures depicting green lizards eating snakes of all kinds.  In a corner
a wandering minstrel plays a tune for the pub befor taking a drink from his own
cup.  The only way out of here is south, back into Main Street.
