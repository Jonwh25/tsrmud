{cThe young man wears plain clothes and does not stand up to his full
height.  His profession is certainly not fighting from the looks of him.  He
seems much more interested in getting the point across in his story than he
does in raising a sword to anyone, yet one can tell by looking closer that
he has seen his share of battles.  {x

{RJesarai, always observing, is here.{x

{bThe woman wears flowing clothes that make her body to appear without
beginning or end.  She wears much jewlery, though none of it is worth too
much.  Her fingers are adorned with rings.  She knows most people in the
city and is the gossip of the town, but only to her friends and the locals
of the town.  Those new to Belkarth Guard she watches with a wary eye and an
interested mind.  {x

Carlethia~
{YCarlethia waits to tell her story here.{x
~
{gThe aged woman stands here, face sagging and wrinkled but wise even
beyond her many years.  Her clothes and her actions are from a time
seemingly long ago but in the scheme of things it was just yesterday that
she was born.  Her eyes tell of a wisdom and sagacity and the stories told
of her suggest that she is perhaps one of the grandest story tellers in the
land.  She speaks in a voice barely above a whisper but most who crowd about
her soften their own voices and their rustlings to hear the words she has to
tell.  {x

{CBalicio and his puppet are here.{x

{rThe man is here with his puppet that is almost like part of his body
because it has been with him for so long.  The serious expression on his
face hints of the horror and despair he has seen and felt in his life.  His
eyes are deep and full of emotion and the only way the man knows to let it
out is to tell his story.  He tells it through his puppet to detatch himself
from the story but it is clear that his story means much to him.  {x

{MThe young girl stands here with two braids in her hair, obviously put in
by herself or a young friend as they are uneven and ragged.  She smiles
sweetly and fold her hands piously as she looks for the next person who
might stop and listen to her story.  Her clothes are like her hair;
apparently she dressed herself as well.  The words of her story roll off her
tongue as the passers by ask the question of her about the tale she loves to
tell.  {x

{cThe black cloak swirls around the body of the one concealing itself. 
There is a story to tell even in the blackness that encompasses this one. 
It is not easy to entice the story from this mysterious one, but once the
story starts it rolls on languidly to its end.  A pair of dark eyes stare
out from beneath the cloak and then are concealed again just as quickly as
they appeared.  The shadows again seek to consume the storyteller.  {x

about her feet and up her body making it difficult to determine where they
end and where she begins.  The magics seem to come to her with ease and
without effort from her.  Her hair flows down about her shoulders like a
waterfall cascading softly down her back.  Even the words that caress her
lips are like honey, sliding out with ease.  The story she tells comes from
the heart no matter how many times it is recited.  {x

{y The little girl is nearly hidden in the skirts of her mother.  She
speaks every now and again, but her voice is so small it is almost missed by
all.  She watches, wide-eyed, the people who pass by and is a learner.  She
learns from those who are around her and soaks in all she hears with
interest, sorting through the information for the parts that might be of
use to her one day.  She smells like a boquet of flowers and her hair is
tinged a slight reddish color from the sun.  {x

{gThe woman standing here appears to be hiding something in her skirts. 
When the crowds lessen, if one looks very close, they see a pair of bright
eyes peeking out of the dress and that is when it becomes evident that the
woman is not alone.  Her hair is not too long but its beauty makes up for
the fact that it is shorter than most.  The impression is given that all she
does is for convenience sake.  She has learned over time that taking care of
a young child is a full time job and in order to do it well she made some
sacrifices.  She waits patiently for those who pass to ask about Rhylus.  {x

in need.  She saved money all her life so that she might be able to help
others.  She herself is dressed poorly and not armored at all.  She carries
no weapons as all she finds she sells in exchange for more money to give to
those in need.  {x

animals in all the Realms and has scars up and down his arms and legs to
show it, as well as one large scar that crosses the whole left side of his
face.  His gaze is full of experience and his hands are strong and welcoming
to those who wish to learn.  Any who come to defile his place of teaching
are likely to face his wrath and ire.  {x

his eye he watches those who pass.  He uses all of his senses to judge if
those passing deserve more than a single thought.  He smells the unfamiliar
in the air when a visitor walks by and he hears the heavy footsteps of those
who hurry past.  He listens, smells, and waits for the person to come by who
might wish to hear his story and then he beckons to them quietly with a bit
of psionics.  {x

special care to keep items on hand that could be useful to the adventurer
and is always willing to show off his wares before selling them.  He has no
qualms about lifting a finger to protect his store if it is under attack and
so he is always a bit wary of strangers.  {x

beard before he is ready to help the customer standing before him.  {x

that he is covered in weapons himself.  Most are decorative in nature, the
handles of the weapons designed just so in order to fit his hand perfectly. 
They are crafted with much care.  He has a few at his waist as well as some
that are hidden beneath his meager clothes.  This is a man who is confident
with his weapons.  He is certain he will kill before he has need of the
armoring and so he takes no precautions in that way.  He hears another
customer arrive and he walks languidly over to help the individual.  {x

learning its exactness in the hopes that he might replicate the design
himself.  He fingers the leather, the lace and the other tools used by his
mentor and smiles to himself as a picture of what he will create comes to
his mind.  He is almost in a trance when he hears footsteps approaching him
and he startles before he speaks to the traveler who has entered in.  {x

have been around and learned much in their time alive.  His eyes take on an
eerie sadness as he delves into the story for those who inquire.  His
clothes are the essentials and nothing more.  He is not one to believe in
frivolity or fancy things.  He is happy being alive and being who he is
though his past is not one of which he is proud.  {x

warrior at heart but learning some of the magics out of necessity.  He is
also a man who has lost a love and who mourns this lost but goes on with
life because he must.  Most sense that in his story lies a warning though he
never comes right out to say it.  His hair brushes his shoulders and his
tired eyes close when he finishes his tale.  He turns away from the crowd
who beckons in order to rest, not physically, but emotionally.  He is
drained.  {x

from Belkarth Guard.  Her demeanor is soft and quiet yet the story she tells
is told with fervor and excitement.  There is something about this woman
that entices those about her to listen to what she has to say and regard it

glance which is what she desires to do.  She is very approachable and has a
set response when she is asked for dinner: "Only if you'll listen to my
story," she says.  By the time the story is finished, most are too
mezmerized to even remember then promise and they walk away in a daze.  {x

and his sight is failing as well, yet he still remembers the story passed on
to him from his grandfather and still tells it with the same intent that he
did when he was but a child.  The man looks tired and weary but that never
stops him from doing what he feels he must do.  He trudges onward telling
all who will listen.  {x

softly and wears little armor because those of the city protect her very
carefully.  She is considered a treasure by many and is protected by most in
the city as she protects those whom she loves.  She has not seen enough of
the world yet to become cynical and harsh like most and she tells her story
with the naivete of a child.  {x

neat and tidy as is the rest of the house.  It is sure that she respects

him after the man and he has been enthralled with him since he was old
enough to understand who Allanon was.  His armor is almost falling off of
his body because it is too large and the sword he wields is almost as big as
he is.  It looks like a child's toy at first, but one slice with it would
show differently.  The boy is not a skilled fighter yet, but he is not
afraid to try out his skills against any who declare themselves evil.  {x

This center, buzzing with motion, is evidently the crux of the city. 
People stand about drinking, chatting, and discussing the goings on of the
city.  The streets are lined with gold on either side and the sidewalks are
platinum.  It is evident that the city is rich and not just in their
economy.  Sights and sounds bombard the fountain and its surroundings, and
it is almost too much to bear but the quieter streets nearby, beckon.

The journey into town is no less magnificant than the fountain square. 
The peoples of the town recount to you stories of time long past.  These are
tales of wars and death, victories and praise.  Wonderment is abounding in
the city.  To the north lies a home of a mother and daugther who live alone.
Those of the city care for them and their home is a place of protection from
the evils of the world told in the stories of the townspeople.

The journey down the road leads past many persons filled with knowledge. 
One of the men of the city stops those who walk by and begins to weave the
tale of the fall of Cepheid.  He tells how Cepheid was once in line for the
role of High Priest of Thallin, seeking truth only later to learn how one of
his own, Palidor, had betrayed him.  The man goes on to tell how in the end,
Cepheid was tossed into the Labyrinth of Cassios.  The man trails off and
before you have a chance to ask a question the man has gone on his way
again.

An intersection of two roads and a woman are here.  The woman's eyes call
out to those traversing the streets.  If one were to listen to the tale she
had to tell they would hear a sad story, one of a man named Krager.  The
woman tells how he was sent on a mission to kill only to learn that the
lives he was taking were those of innocent people.  This thought comes to
his mind as a scene plays out before him of rape and murder.  Krager looks
into the eyes of the innocent woman and rescues her from the hands of those
who will kill her.  They go on to have a child they call Variant, but Krager
dies at the hands of his own men.  The story is a sad one until Variant's
voice booms into your ears, "Welcome to the Realms".

of Cepheid?"  She goes on to tell the tale of Cepheid.  He was in the
Labyrinth for over 5000 years and much had changed but the language of the
elves had remained nearly the same so he inquired of the elves what had
happened.  He decided that his new place was among Retribution and fought
against the forces of Oblivion for a time, but with more intensive study he
changed his mind.  He was wrong to abandon Thallin and his beliefs so he
turned his forces again to fighting for Strife and to make Strife a powerful
force to be reckoned with.

The knowledge of the psioncists fill the air and the sounds of
spellcasting are all around.  At first glance, it would appear that the town
has grown crazy.  People wave their hands about calling on their gods and
chanting phrases that to the untrained ear sound like babble.  In the center
of the road is a hexagon.  One man stands in the middle of it and if you
listen closely you can hear him tell a story of Cepheid and a hexagon. 
Cepheid was not one who starved for magics.  He preferred to live and die by
the sword, yet to call back Thallin he knew would take drastic measures.  In
order to accomplish this task he had to kill all standing in his way,
including one he cared for dearly, Mira.  Then, there were rituals, words,
incantations and the hexagon.  At first it seemed as if nothing had
happened, but then out of the air, Thallin appeared.  The magic has worked
its course and Thallin had returned.

The sounds of voices surrounding all speak the same: "The Psioncist's
Spire, very close, east of here."  It is as if all energies in the city are
focused to the center of learning and all energy that isn't focused in that
direction should be according to the people's of the town.  All traffic
heads towards the college, but no traffic out.  It is as if those who travel
that way never come back.  The streets are no longer paved with gold. 
Instead, there are words inscribed in them.  They all have a story to tell
and one could learn volumes just by standing in the streets reading.  The
traffic does not allow for those who stand around and so the traveler either
moves along or moves out of the way.

{WPsionicist's Way{x~
This spot in the city is unlike any other anywhere in town.  It is a
place of nothingness, blackness, ash, destruction and decay.  It is very out
of place in the spotless, clean city and the thought crosses most minds of
why and how did this place become as it is.  The only other thing of notice
is a man here whose soul purpose is to warn those who are foolish.  He tells
the story of Raff.  Raff was a man who killed his father and all those about
him.  He killed many gods until Ao finally stopped him and scattered his
parts to the wind.  Then, one day, Ao brought him back and the only thing
that Raff leaves in his wake today is what is seen here.  The warning is
that those who follow such a path will reap the same destruction and
blackness that Raff does.

Just south of this place lies the entrance to the Psionicist's Spire.  It
is a house and college of teaching and learning.  This is a city that
believes that knowledge is the key to success.  The entrance way greets
those who cross it by its exotic marble columns and grand archway. 
Sometimes learning is intentional and sometimes accidental but either way,
according to the people of the town, it is a good thing.  A statue is here
to illustrate the point and the name Draven is scribed underneath it.  There
is also a short story scribed beneath it for those who look very close.

story~
Draven was a man of much pain.  The pain so overwhelmed him that he went
crazy, so some say, and killed his mother and his father.  He killed many in
his madness.  One day Sapphon came to him explaining to him that his deeds
helped to keep the balance of the Realms.  This knowledge, not sought, but
accepted, helped Draven to come to terms with himself and his deeds.  No one
knows how he achieved immortality though some venture to guess, but to this
day he is known as the Lord of Free Will.

The walls of the Spire continue alongside the road, as amazing as ever. 
The road in front of the Spire is fit for a king in appearance and in
cleanliness.  This is the high classed part of town.  Though all sorts of
people traverse these roads, few people can call this street home.  The
knowledgable and those less fortunate all come here seeking to enhance their
minds and their magic.  This place is dedicated to the memory of Allanon and
his thirst for knowledge.  A small boy, dressed in oversized armor and
holding a sword in his hand says, "I'm Allanon, protector of the good and
just".  He goes on to tell how Allanon was found and asked to unite many
clans under him for the purpose of killing the Chaons and Beowolf.  After
the war and his measured success he was exalted to a higher power and is
worshiped to this day by many.

Psioncist's Way continues on just outside the Psioncist's Spire.  People
on the streets practice their newly learned skills.  The walls of the
building tower above those who walk past.  There is a grand mural on the
wall depicting Remik and his involvement in the People's Alliance.  The
mural shows that the People's Alliance played a big part in the history of
Belkarth Guard.  A figure in long white flowing robes speaks of Remik and
tells the story of the Alliance.  The People's Alliance was backed by the
Psionicist's Spire who taught them the art of psionics and empowering
objects.  Remik, as part of this alliance, traveled with the Chaon, masking
himself as one of their own and then crushing them from inside.  All was
good until one day, Anacreon exerted control over Remik and he spilled the
plans of the Alliance to Anacreon.  Anacreon then sent the word out to his
leaders of the Chaon army and killed Remik.  With Remik's medallion, he
miraculously lived and went to try to stop the messages from being delivered
but he was too late and the Alliance was dead.  To this day he still hunts
Beowolf and the Chaons, but with a new power, immortality.

The Psionicist's Spire has been reached at last.  It is the home of much
learning and teaching.  The skills of the psionics are taught and learned
here, passed down from one person to the next.  It is even more magnificant
in person than it was in the distance.  The intricate designs that are woven
throughout the door are detailed and exact.  A guard stands nearby making
sure that the sanctity of the Spire is not compromised and that those inside
are not brought to harm.  Looking up, one follows the tower of the Spire up
into the clouds, unable to even find the top.  To climb the stairs inside
must be some task, but whatever is at the top is surely worth it to those
who make the trek.

The Psioncist's Spire is to the west.  The street here is well traveled
and busy.  The crowd shuffles along those who do not keep up with the quick
pace.  The smell of magic lingers in the air and the sounds of teaching can
be heard not too far away.  The tellers of stories are numerous on this
street.  One of these, a little girl, no more than 10, stops those who pass
by to tell them the story of Variant.  Variant is the son of Krager and
Jessica, learned in the art of psionics and the magic of the Chaon.  Variant
fought the forces of Chaon and in so doing eventually came face to face with
Beowolf.  One of Variant's followers made a diversion and he slipped into
the Wildgate.  There was a battle in the Wildgate between Variant and Dymeir
ending with Dymeir trapped in the Wildgate.  Once Dymeir finally escaped
with the help of Beowolf, Ao made Variant immortal so that he could protect
the Wildgate and locate Dymeir, thus the beginning of Variant's role as a
god to the Realms.

The Spire seems to grow taller with every step closer to it as it looms
and casts a shadow on all it surveys.  The people in the streets move
quickly.  The precious metals making up this road feel almost like ice
underneath the feet and in order not to fall, it takes concentration and
effort for most.  There is a man working a small wooden puppet attached to
strings sitting on the side of the road.  He moves the puppet to tell a
story; the story how Beowolf came to be.  There was one called Zyfain who
was worried that there was not enough Chaos so he decided to create some of
his own.  The only way he knew to do this was by draining off life force
which also drains part of the victim's soul.  In order to do this he created
Beowolf out of shale in his likeness.  He trained him in the arts of magic
first and then blades as he improved.  In their last battle, Beowolf almost
killed Zyfain until he realized he had hurt his father and was concerned. 
Zyfain took the opportunity to teach Beowolf his final lesson: Never let
emotions get in the way of victory.  Beowolf went along creating Chaos in
his wake until one day Dymeir confronted Beowolf with his real purpose in
existing: to breed Chaos for Zyfain himself.  Once Beowolf learned this he
killed his father and thus Beowolf came to be part of these Realms.

{WThe Way of the Gods{x~
The city changes as a new road is approached.  The street is name The Way
of the Gods because those who linger on the road are the ones who have
studied the Gods and their history.  They are eager to share this knowledge
with others in the hopes of instilling insight and foresight into those who
traverse the Realms.  It is the choice of all who pass to listen or to
ignore the information given though most who come to Belkarth Guard come for
some sort of training.  An aged woman stands on the corner seeking to tell
the story of Ao and his depature.  If you listen closely, you can hear her
say these words in a hushed whisper: Ao was one of three children and the
only one who survived after the three children battled between themselves. 
Ao, in his life, learned a lesson of balance and how important it was, in
his view, to keep the Realms safe.  He also, wanted to follow the path of
his father to a higher spiritual level.  Once he finally felt that the
Realms were balanced enough to stay for a very long time, he left the Realms
to achieve this spiritual level of being and very few claim to have seen or
heard from him since.

The town moves faster here at the intersection and it is almost a
struggle to move around the people without redirecting your path again to
avoid another person.  An older lady sits at the corner of the road
observing all who pass her gaze.  She was a teller of fortunes but now she
soaks in the past, desiring to learn from the mistakes of those who came
before her and making others aware.  There is a sign on the side of the road
directing all who gaze on it to the Psionicist's Spire, the college and
center of learning.

As the journey along the street continues, the people walk by with a
quest in their hearts and a quickness in their steps.  People come from all
over to learn the ways of the Psionicists and to learn the stories of a time
from long ago.  A young man stands on the side of the road pantomiming a
story.  Those who take time to try to understand hear a tale of the God of
Faith.  It is a tale of great joy to those who hold out any faith.  The man
pantomimes how a beggar boy was saddened day after day as the stale bread
was given to the birds and he was left to hunger but the god changed a
baker's heart one day and he began to feed the loaves to the boy, took him
in and learned that he had a talent for carving.  The young beggar, and the
lives of many others were changed by this one.  The young man scratches in
the dirt just off to the side of the road the letters to form Yaso.  The
details come together and the God of Faith is revealed.

As the traveler continues upon the path, the street remains the same. 
The people of the city are meticulous about upkeep.  It seems that they are
meticulous about most everything.  A very young woman approaches those who
walk by, hardly more than a teenager herself, but with a grand story to
tell.  She tells the story of Thallin and his fall.  She tells how he has
been known as the God of Truth yet Ao learned that he was manipulating the
sides of good and evil for Strife.  Ao did not approve of this and so there
was a battle.  A huge earthquake caused Thallin's castle to fall and crush
him, but those who really knew Thallin understood that they would see him
again.  She looks over her shoulder as if expecting Thallin to appear at any
minute and then scurries away to her tasks for the day.

This room is a haven to the weary and hurting traveller.  The walls are

There is a smell of blood in the air accompanied by a strange silence. 
Moans of pain are heard all around but they are quickly dispelled by the
presence of one who knows, a healer who stands here before you.  There is a
sense that there is another one who has magical abilities lurking nearby but
it is difficult to sense the exact direction.

the door shut out the roughness of all the is happening outside and the only
things evident to those in this room are the others in the room with them. 
There are no windows and only one door, the same one used to enter the room.
The walls are pale and nondistracting.  The room exists only for the purpose
of relaxing and meditating.  Oftentimes, the spellcasters of the Realms come
here to rest.

baby.  The city cares for their needs.  They have ample food and clothing,
comfortable beds for themselves and they scraped together money in order to
buy a spare bed for any visitors who might cross their path.  The smell of
warm soup wafts towards the door arousing the hunger of the neighbor hood
animals.  The general feeling of this place is that anyone who needed a
place to stay would always be welcome here.  The woman invites you to sit
down and have a bowl of soup with her and her daughter before you have to

guards the house viciously and there is nothing of value out in sight. 
There is a piece of stone lying on a desk near the door and when you ask her

fell and crushed Thallin.  This stone gives them hope for a new tomorrow and

fit into town is that it is as clean and neat as the rest of town. 
Unbeknownst to those unfamiliar with this road, this is where many secret
meetings are held in the town and where shady and even those deals not so
shady are made.  This is also a place where people come to dream about the
future and reminisce about the past.

lesson being taught just off to the side of the road.  Knowledge emitted
from the Spire fills up all the spaces not occupied by people walking the
streets.  Hunger to learn is seen in the eyes of those who walk by and heard
in the quickness of their steps toward the college.  The street continues on

bestow knowledge that could be benificial to the Spire.  The entrance way
smells of sandalwood and there is a hint of some other spice in the air. 
The floors are a mirror-like substance that reflects the faces that enter

which is a big change from the rest of Spire, filled with teaching, learning
and endless chattering.  The walls of the room have colors that seemingly
flow into one another, relaxing those who watch them intently.  In one
corner of the room, there is a tank of water that produces bubbles from
nowhere.  The bubbles rise to the top of the water very slowly.  There is a
light shining on the water that changes colors and intensity as the mood of
the room changes.  This room is the perfect room to enter at the end of a
long and tedious day.

the Spire.  There are those who have forgotten what it means to thirst for
knowledge and crave learning.  The pictures show these people at the times
of their death; some hung, some tortured, some starved, some beaten and left
to die slowly.  Those of the Spire dislike war and killing, but they detest
those who have forgotten their reason for being and joining with them.  This
is where people are brought to be warned and chastised for their behavior in
hopes that they might turn around and be the man or woman they once were.

small table with four chairs around it.  A few pieces of parchment and a
quill lie on the table waiting to be used in case of an emergency meeting. 
There are drawings and paintings on the wall of notorious and special people
from the past years.  The picture that really catches the eye is the one of
Qmtarr.  The frame tells the story of Qmtarr and how he came to be a god in
the Realms.  A number of those in the Spire worship Qmtarr as they believe
him to be very powerful in his role of DreamWeaver.

Qmtarr comes from a town called J'Har.  One day, his town, much to his
chagrin was destroyed by the wildgate as it ripped through the town,
destroying it and pulling him through.  He found himself in the Realms and
quickly found his place among the group called Rebellion.  He fell in love
with Kaitlyn, who became leader of the Realms, but there was much arguing
and tension between them.  This arguing, one day, caused Kaitlyn to leave
and Qmtarr was very sad.  His sadness helped him to see how he was wrong in
his fighting and arguing all the time.  One day, Bryelle, the goddess of
Rebellion, told Qmtarr that her time was finished and that she was leaving
the Realms.  She left Qmtarr to lead Rebellion and gave him the gift of
immortality in parting.  And so, Qmtarr came to be as he is to this day, the
DreamWeaver.

on the majority of those who pass through the room and certainly not those
who place their hands on the banister for the first time.  The stairs
themselves look like marble, though they are made of a different, unknown
material.  Heading north leads back towards the entrance of the Spire and to
the East leads further down the hallway into other parts of the college.

they gladly share them with anyone who will listen.  These stories are

The road that leads from Belkarth's Guard is short and quiet, but it
gives the traveler time enough to think on what was said and heard in town
as well as to digest the stories that were told.  There is a choice at the
end of the path and the traveler is forced to make a decision: head back
into town for more learning or choose one of three paths.  The roads are
merely labeled Beowolf, Allanon and Draven.  The sign hammered into the
ground next to the words might help those who pass this way to make a more
informed decision about the path they will choose.  The message from the
city is more than clear.  The path that each person chooses in life is
mirrored by others who have walked the path before us.  This step out into
the world is very vital and it could mean life or death.

{WThe Ancients Way{x~
The swelling of the crowds lessen the further you are away from the
Spire.  There are still people milling about, heading towards the
marketplace to buy the necessities of life.  Story tellers lurk, but not as
many as in the northern part of town.  Streets here are less ornate, but
still well-kempt and proper.  The smell of baked goods wafts in from the
south and the din of voices clangs in from the north.  There is not much
worthy of remark here.

The sounds of the marketplace grow with each step.  Every now and again,
a word or two can be understood but it is still a short distance away.  The
smell of fresh leather is evident now.  An older gentlemen stops those in
the street who will listen.  He announces himself as a descendant of Elias. 
He goes on to tell a story of the time that Variant worked together with
Beowolf.  Of course, Beowolf wanted something in exchange.  Variant agreed
to do as Beowolf wished if he would only help him defeat the armies of Raff
and Raff himself.  So Beowolf killed off his armies and while he was doing
so, Variant took care to kill Raff and banished him "Back to the hell which
spawned you."  Variant was left to his victory, wondering when Beowolf would
call down this favor from him and what it might be.

The cries of the merchants grow stronger with every step, the words from
their lips clear now.  The clanging of the hammers against metal grows and
echoes off the cobblestone path.  The Psionicist's Spire looms to the north
and even so far away, there are still those with a story to tell.  A child
dressed all in black sits on the ground ignoring those who pass by, but he
has learned much in his short time of being.  If one were to stop and ask
him he would tell of the falling of the Triad.  The three: Draven, Allanon
and Beowolf made up the Triad.  Draven, the seeker of balance, who
questioned his beliefs one day because of Thallin and then went mad, killing
and destroying all in his path, including Allanon, was the first.  Beowolf,
the second sought out Variant to repay the favor he owed and asked him to
kill Draven for all he had done and much to Variant's dismay, he followed
through.  Then Beowolf was distraught because his plans were foiled.  He
could not reach the Wildgate, thus the falling of the Triad.

The merchants are just out of reach now.  The sounds of the merchants
declaring their prices ring through the air.  "Come one, come all.  The
prices are low and the time is short."  Behind the tops of the tallest
merchant's building, the Spire is still easy to see.  The cobblestone
streets are more difficult to walk upon than the streets of northern
Belkarth Guard yet the people are as friendly as ever.  Everyone is eager to
lend a hand and offer directions to those visiting the town and they seem
proud to live in this city.

Psioncist's Spire.  Many scholars have passed these gates before and many
who seek to gain knowledge will pass these gates in the future.  The gate
looms overhead, but it is small compared to the Spire.  This gate leads into
the city directly into the market.  If one were to head north, they might

counter offering his wares for sale.  The smell of leather and chainmail
attack the nostrils.  The street continues on to other stores and merchants.
The man who runs the armory lives just south of here and his house is open

The sights and smells assault those who wander into the armory.  All
around are different sorts of protection for any size, shape and breed of
adventurer.  Some of the armor is so odd that it is hard to imagine what
sort of creature would wear it.  There is a certificate on the wall that
says, "Gwendydar, apprentice to Sythaline.  Graduated with honors".  The
certificate confirms the handiwork seen with the eyes and it is easy to see
that hard work and plenty of time and attention are given to each piece of
equipment in the store.

about this room and below each are instructions for how to cast them and the
effects that each has.  The floor is made of some type of strange tiling
that has the words of scrolls of old written on them.  Even if those who
entered the Spire never talked to a soul, as long as they could read, they
would learn volumes.  There is a burning smell like a spell gone wrong
creeping in from the outdoors.  The hall continues further into the spire
towards the south and outside to the north.

in the street here fighting and trying out their new purchases.  Both raise
their swords, clinking and smashing together.  After a gruling match, they
call it a draw and declare their weapons excellently crafted.  They walk
down the streets happy with the purchases they have made and ready to go
hunt for their families.  Just north of here lies the home of the weapon
crafter and it is open to all who dare enter.

swords and a few weapons that most have only heard tale of and never seen.

staggering.  The yelps, whinnies, cries and other assorted sounds of animals
can be heard from the north.  From the south, a voice rises, "Sit, stay,
good boy.  Now for the real test.  Kill".  The scratching, clawing and cry
are testament to the fact that the animal has learned its lesson well. 
Heading into the training grounds for the animals might not be such a
fabulous idea, but then again, one could learn a lot from a person who can
teach an animal to kill.

Entering the home of Gwendydar one notices all sorts of odd contraptions.
Some are stretching leather for pieces of armor, others link chain for chain
mail.  Hammers and various tools abound and lie about the house in disarray.
There are no pictures on the wall and no paintings.  Nothing of asthetic
value has made its way into this home.  Instead, it is filled with the
workings of a master of his art, the art of making equipment for others.  A
young boy, no more than thirteen sits in the room with a drawing and work of
his own.  "My name is Chrystar and I am Gwendydar's apprentice", he says. 
There is a strength and a pride in his voice that only comes from one who
has worked hard to reach where he is.

place.  This is where he tries out his newest creations in order to see if
they have the sort of quality that he demands from his weapons.  The weapons
on display are for show, though they could kill if ever put to the test. 
These are in stark contrast to the weapons he normally sells that are only
made for killing and are not decorative at all.  This is the house of a
skilled man who most would not dare to cross.

of these animals is well worth the expense in the eyes of the Master
Trainer.  No one lingers long in the store.  Business is done and then
people leave; at least those who have some aptitude in dealing with others.

animals how to behave in different situations.  The animals are all chained
and bound so as not to attack without provokation.  That is a good thing,
since the wild look in their eyes shows that they would devour the first
thing that walked past if they had any chances to do so.  There are numerous
people gathered watching the training and searching for the best creature to
serve them that they might buy when the time comes.

waiting for the freshest goods to come available.

one could even call it a home.  There are also all sorts of utensils spread
about, most noticeable the butcher knife with blood covering it.  The sounds
of a dying animal reach the doorway.  Another animal has been killed for
nourishment, but by the looks of that butcher knife, most people would not
want to cross the owner of this house.

the general store.  There is a little girl holding out a cup full of money. 
At first glance, she looks like a typical beggar girl, but the words out of
her mouth show different.  "If you need some money, adventurer, please take
a few coins.  If you don't, please leave it for someone who does."  How odd!
Not a beggar, but a giver.  This city sure does take care of its own and its
visitors, too.

anything that is not yours."  Evidenced by the neatness of the house, the

the enforcement is and why it is so very important to give everything a
place.  Those who enter would certainly be wise to leave the house as

different.  Those who head north, head towards the tall Psioncist's Spire
and those who head west head towards the shops of the town.

enter with a grand archway covered in picture stories.  If one looks close
enough he can follow the lines of history along the archway.  The stories
portrayed are the handiwork of a great artist because no other would be able
to tell the story so well without words.  The town is evidently one that
takes pride in itself and in learning all it can about the past in order to
keep history from repeating itself time and again.  The Psionicist's Spire
is clearly visible from here and it is a magnificant sight to behold.  Those
who desire knowledge are drawn to it almost like zombies.

There are many who come to Belkarth Guard seeking out knowledge but a few
happen here by mere chance; some would call it luck.  The glory of the city,
the majesty of the Spire, the fact that the air is okay to breath can all be
attributed in some fashion to this factor some call luck and though few know
him and even fewer still understand him, there is a God of this luck.  A
picture is carved into the sidewalk here of a very short man walking along
and a comet striking down an army in his wake.  A little girl looks up at
you and says, "Rhylus".  Her mother is standing nearby to explain.  Luck
follows Rhylus and no one will say if it is good or bad, but most will say
some of both.  One day Rhylus was walking past the armies of Chaon and a
meteor came down, striking the army and killing a large number of them.  A
voice came to him thanking him for his help and he has been an immortal to
this day.

The crowds have lessened a bit and the sounds of the market place are
beginning to become clearer.  The Spire still appears large even though it
is some distance away.  The street here has the word "Bryelle" inscribed in
it and off to the left of the word is a statuette of a beautiful woman.  A
young lady dressed in long flowing garments begins to speak of Bryelle
remembering her fondly and speaking of the deeds she did to help the Realms
and to make it what it is today.  It all started with the destruction
Beowolf was causing.  Out of the destruction he felt the blast of a
psionicist only to note that the blast came from inside a burning house.  He
went inside to find the mentalist and find a baby instead.  He did not know
why he saved her but he raised her as his daughter.  He intended to do as
Zyfain had done with him; use her then discard her.  He had his trusted
teach her in all the ways of magic, swords and of course fostered her
psionics.  Once she was learned he had her use the absorption spell to
increase the power of the Chaons until one day she cast the ritual and saw
images of the cruelty of her own father.  That very night she ran away and
has rebelled against him to this day.  She vowed to slay her father and
avenge the lives of those he had taken and still does to this day.

The search for truth permiates the city.  The seeking of knowledge is
first in the minds of nearly all who abide here and those who visit as well.
Thus the story of Thallin is told time and time again like the fairy tale
many wish it was but the nightmare it truly is to those who seek truth. 
There are many who tell the story but few who tell it better than the one
who stands at this corner.  The cloaked one tells the story in a voice
without gender or familiarity.  He tells how Thallin was the God of Truth
until one day, Thallin's anger got the best of him and he killed all those
who followed Palidor, the one who had perverted the truth of Thallin.  That
day, Palidor made Thallin doubt.  From that day on, Thallin watched the
Realms with interest and saw the truth he had so believed in turn to more
and more doubt.  He learned that when two people share different beliefs it
causes Strife and so he decided he would foster Strife instead of truth as a
final twist of irony and so it goes even to this day.

{WUpward still{x~
The staircase continues upward and looking out the window here one can
see even beyond the gates of Belkarth Guard.  The Realms looms out below and
the people in the city look like tiny mice of different colors as they are
so far away now.  The Realms doesn't look as large or as terrifying as it
does to some when in its midst.  It is easy to be removed and distant when
this far away from the action in the center of the Realms.

{WTop of the Spire{x~
Looking out of the winow from this height can be unnerving.  The Realms
is almost invisible through all the clous at this height.  What one can
see, if they look very har, are the edges of the Realms, the trees marking
the edges and the rivers flowing about to show where the Realms ends and
another land begins.  The air in the top of the Spire is thin and it is
harder to breathe this high up in the Spire.  The only option now is to head
back down the same way the adventurer arrived.

{WSurrounding Sound{x~
Music fills the room consistently.  This is where the bards meet to share
and improve their skills.  For this reason, the sounds of outside are shut
out except for the sounds of music which of course are always welcomed.  The
room itself has a mural on the wall of musical instruments, many of which
only exist in pitctures.  The room is always filled with lutes, flutes,
harps and many musical instruments for people that do not have their own or
cannot carry theirs about all the time.  All are welcome in this place
whether to appreciate the music or make the music.

{WDonations{x~
This is the place in Belkarth Guard that has been designated by the
people as a place for helping others.  Those who have more give to those by
leaving swords, clothes, food, and other assorted items here.  Those who
have less come to this place to reclaim these things in the good faith that
they will one day come back to this place to return that which they have
borrowed or used in the name of improving themselves.

{WThe Local Pub{x~
A simple pub with about.  Few comfortable chairs as well as a table is
here.  The pub is out of place in the town and is rarely visited by the
locals.  It is here more for the security of the visitors who come here than
the people who inhabit the town.  The pub has some games scattered a These
are all games of wit enjoyed by the townspeople and played for fun, but
those who do not enjoy such mind stimulating activities may be bored by
them.  The drinks flow and the talk continues throughout the night in the
local pub and people come and go with ease.
