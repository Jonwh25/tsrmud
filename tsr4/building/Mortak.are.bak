Road to Chamerone~
This road is made from cobblestones of every color.  The stones have been
smoothed, perhaps for centuries, by river water.  The cracks between stones
have been filled with sand, which makes the road excellent for travelling, 
and it serves its purpose well.  Merchants fill the street with their
carts, heading for the town in the distance.  A few people who
obviously aren't merchants also travel the road.  More move towards
the town than away.  The sound of horse hooves and a variety of
pleasant smells fill the air.
