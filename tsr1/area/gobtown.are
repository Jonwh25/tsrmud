This passageway winds through the black stone heart of the town. 
Stagnant water stand in pools as the tunnel descends.  Occasionly you come
across knawed bones and piles of rotting rags.  You hear rats scattering
before you.  The tunnel starts to dry as the tunnel begins to slope upwards.

Caravan Square~
Dust is every where as well as the smell of animals.  You see camels,
horses, mules, and much stranger animals.  Boxes and bundles are unloaded
and loaded from various carts.  All along the edge of the square are large
tents that the caravan masters own.  All agree that the caravans have
brought in more people and trade to the town.

You are on the eastern side of the square.  A caravan is sitting here. 
It looks like is is ready to leave.  Although there is less activity on this
side of the square, there is just as much dust.  Many people come here to
gawk at the animals.  Some search out the caravan masters, either for items
of particular interest or to join a caravan out of this town.

potted shrubbery.  A bed roll of silk and wool is spread across the floor. 
Against the back wall is a fancy writing desk.  This is by far the plainest

A mind numbing insence fills the room with dense smoke.  The quiet
recitation of mantras adds a gentle hum in the back ground.  The walls seem
to absorb the light.  Inlaid into the floor in bronze is the symbol of
