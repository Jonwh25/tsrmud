area, and had major writers block. Well, Simba sort of
nudged him and he broke out of his block. With Rainman
doing the main debugging and alot of dark beer, this
area was created for your amusement. The secret to sailing
is that all simple seas never border on grounding reefs.
If you are in shallows type exit after each move to look
for shoals ( they wont show in the night ). There is a main
clockwise current running in the high seas, so don't sleep
on the high seas, or you will drift.. There are alot of
clues throughout isles so don't just powermud and miss all.
Lok charmed me so you wouldn't just mindlessly butcher me.'

Incredibly, above you, suspended in mid-air, is a huge mountain. You
bob in the shallow waters shaded by the flying mountain. You crane your
neck upward and see high above you massive chains and winches which
support many pirate ships beneath the flying mountain. Also, high above
you, you can make out a rope ladder. Sadly the ladder, too, has been 
wound most of the way up, and is far out of your reach. Your boat bumps

You are sailing on the high seas of the pirate lords. The ocean is a 
deep blue, and long slow swells rock your ship.
   It's amazing, but the water here seems to look shallower, although
you know that cannot be true at this distance from the shores. It
almost looks like magic could be at play at this particular spot --
which causes you to remember back to an old tale of an underwater city
somewhere in these waters....

You shimmy up your mast and look at the atoll. The atoll is a circular

can easily recognize the masts of several docked ships, and you see
houses on stilts.
