'When I was an able boy of 18, I worked for my dad in the mine. One day
I struck out in a new direction, and broke through to this green meadow
here. I followed the meadow to this temple and found an aged warrior
here garbed as I am now. He gave me this sickle and robe and froze me
to this spot. He told me that my task was to wait for the day when a
hero would step forth from the mine, and if that hero should prove
worthy, you may find release. He said the exit would be hidden from all
but the chosen ones. You have come through. Show me you are worthy
hero, and best me in combat. The forces of evil rise again, and the
land sings out for a champion. Can you not hear her singing through the
temple? Strike now and prove yourself worthy. If you win seek knowledge
in the runes of the sickle and save the cross for dire need. May god be
with you.'

Puck's Room~
You are hunched over in Puck's room.  You know this by the sign 
that says "Pucks stuff- keep your grubby hands off".  There is a 
bed of forest leaves, some rude hollowed out shelves, a tiny table 
with a half full jack of ale, and a great pile of junk beneath the sign.

Little People's Bar and Grill~
You squeeze into the famous Little People's Bar and Grill!  Conversation
abruptly stops as you enter.  Around you little people are drinking from
beautifully crafted crystal glasses.  The smoke is thick and buoys your
spirits.  Maybe you should stay a while and try the faerie wine?   A low 
tunnel heads west, and you hear a thunderous racket coming from the east.

You are once again hunched over in a earthy burrow.  There is sign 
of much passage through here, many little feet have packed the

sized door.

Bowling Alley~
You are hunched over in a bowling alley!  Little people are rolling 
round objects down grooved tracks at long white targets.  The whole 
cave echoes in a dreadful crash each time they hit the targets! 
Oh you wish you had that glass of faerie wine.  To the west is the 
Little People's Bar and Grill.

Hall of the Faerie Queen~
You stand in the hall of the Faerie Queen.  Rainbow colors dance 
across the room in a colorful display.  Faerie folk flutter furiously 
fanning forge fires.  Say that 3 times fast.  Maybe you should have had 
that faerie wine.
