There is but one thing thats is scarier than a drunk frenchman, and
that is a drunk fisherman.  Unfortunatly Louis the Lush is both.
Stumbling and giggling insanely, he lurches from rack to rack
sampling from every bottle he touches.

Lich mage Noam~
The Lich Mage~
Tills long dead arch-rival, Noam the mage, shambles forward.
~
With worms and maggots crawling out of his eyes, and draped in
a long rotted purple robe, Noam is hideous.  Once Tills only
friend and compatriot, the two were driven apert by Tills 
jealousy and quest for power.  Until one day it seemed to friends
and family that Noam vanished from the face of the earth....
 
 
      Things were arranged that way...

The Chaos Demon~
The Chaos Demon howls at you from the Summoning circle.
~
This is obviously what finally killed Till the Mad.  With a goat head,
a human body, and cat legs, it is truly  a hideous sight.
It lunges for you, thirsting for your soul, but is stopped
suddenly at the edge of the circle.  It howls in rage, the noise seems
to drive spikes into your brain.  It seems dim around the beast, as though
the very light itself is loath to touch the beast.  Around its neck you notice
an inky black key, unfortunaly to get the key you must enter the circle, 
thus creating a way for the demon to leave it.

The street~
The street is dark in this section of town.  Suddenly a cold wind comes
from the south and chills you to the bone.  To your left stands a tall tower
made of dark stone.  It was not there a second ago; or was it?  The tower
stands at least three stories high and is surrounded by a wrought iron
fence.  A gate swings from the fence by one hinge.  A cobblestone path leads
up to the front door of the tower.  It might be wise to continue walking
past the tower.

Cobblestone Path~
The path to the tower is made of dark cobblestone and has seen better
days.  The air seems to grow colder the closer you move towards the tower
and a low howling wind has started coming from the south.  As you look behind
you towards the street you notice that it is no longer there.  It has been
replaced by a thick gray mist, which seems to be taking over the courtyard. 
The only untouched place will be the tower.  The front door of the tower
opens slowly, greeting you with a draft of warm air.  A scream comes from
within.

Entance Way~
The entranceway is warm and welcoming compared to the weather that is
starting outside.  There is an iron chandelier hanging from the ceiling by a
thick chain.  The candles in it give off a thick black smoke that rises to
the ceiling ten feet above.  The walls and floor are polished to a black the
color of the night sky.  There are four doorways in the room: one to the
north, one to the east, one to the west, and the one you came through to the
south.  As you watch, the door to the south disappears.

chopping block, covered in dried blood.  Over the fire, a spit turns by
itself.  Upon the spit is some form of meat, with many protruding faces
screaming in agony.  The sound is maddening, and you feel your sanity

floor and shattered.  But the object wich draws your attention is a large
slate table with straps at both ends and both sides.  The straps appear to
have been meant to hold down a persons head, legs and arms.  Doorways lead

Upstairs Hallway~
The hallway is very warm and gives you a cozy feeling, almost as if you
were back HOME, safe by the fire.  But you quickly remember where you are. 
The hallway is of the same polished black stone that you saw in the
downstairs hallways.  Covering the walls are deep scratches made by some
type of animal, but what type is unkown.  The hallway continues west and
north.  The stairs which have brought you here are gone.

You have entered one of the towers guest bedrooms.  The room is very

to suit its needs.  The room is warmed and lit by a fire in the firplace,
but the fireplace has no wood in it.  The window in the south wall looks out
into the inky blackness of some void.  The room is decorated very plainly
with a small writing table and chair against the east wall, and a very

floor is the skin of a very large bear, used as a throw rug.  A small
writing desk and chair are against the south wall and a bed is against the
north.  The bed looks very inviting to sleep on despite your uneasy feeling.

available space making vision difficult.  The curtains on the window over

chair and writing desk are a pile of rotten wood.  The only thing seen from

been reduced to rubble.  The curtians above the bed are in tatters and the

is the tower anyway?"  Then you notice there is a set of foot prints on the

is a large chain and a broken iron neck collar.  Obviously the chain was
designed to hold a large creature, but was not strong enough to do the job.

The smell of sulpher is overwhelming, making you gag as you enter this

eighty feet, and could not fit into a tower this size.  The double doors
which you have come through have vanished and become a part of the south
wall.  Symbols cover almost every inch of the walls.  A large summoning
circle has been ingraved into at least half the floor.  A small iron door is
to the east.  Suddenly a bright flash of light blinds you and an insane
howling can be heard getting louder and louder.
