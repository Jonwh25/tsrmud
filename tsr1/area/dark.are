Quetzalcoatl the Plumed Serpent God~
Quetzalcoatl raises his arms skyward in drawing energy from the skies.
~
Legend states that he was the child of the Sun and a virgin goddess.
He was so filled with the love of all living things that he would
not pick a flower or harm an animal.  He ruled an empire of creativity
and kindness which greatly angered the crafty Lord of Death. Quetzalcoatl
symbolizes the union of matter and spirt, instinct and transcendence.

Tezcatlipoca the Crafty Lord of Death~
This crafty Lord of Death has a smile so cruel it chills the air.
~
Tezcatlipoca is tall of stature and very handsome or he would be if it
were not for the hard glittering look in his eyes.  Crafty beyond words,
he seems to have a talent for finding and using a person's vanity to
manipulate them as he did to Quezaltcoal by showing him a mirror which
made Quezaltcoal terrified of the signs of aging which he saw in that
mirror.

Coyote the Wily Trickster~
A large powerful silvery coyote is cavorting about leaping into the air.
~
This trickster-hero was much beloved in his native lands.  Though he varied
from kind to cruel and form naive to wily he has a vulnerablilty about
him which appealed to his followers.  Usually oversexed, indulging as he
pleased in food, drink and women it was said that he brought the world into
being.  They identified with the imperfections of this world which must
have been made by an imperfect creator, whose tricks often backfired.

Baragar is a handsome young man with long white hair, and deep blue eyes.
He would appear to be almost angelic were it not for the diabolical gleam

The frozen captive is so gratified by your kindness that

area, and had major writers block. Well, Simba sort of
nudged him and he broke out of his block. With Rainman
doing the main debugging and alot of dark beer, this
area was created for your amusement. The secret to sailing
is that all simple seas never border on grounding reefs.
If you are in shallows type exit after each move to look
for shoals ( they wont show in the night ). There is a main
clockwise current running in the high seas, so don't sleep
on the high seas, or you will drift.. There are alot of
clues throughout isles so don't just powermud and miss all.
Lok charmed me so you wouldn't just mindlessly butcher me.'

    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are

wildgate~
The whirling storm is obviously not a natural phenomena.  You have heard
rumors and legends, and feel certain that this must be the fabled Wildgate,
the catalyst of the second and third Dark Age of Shaikari.  The gate is said
to exist on all planes simultaneously, and to those who know it's secrets
allows passage to untold wonders and also great peril.  It was through the
gate that Dymeir unleashed his hordes upon the universe, and through the
gate that he fled when he escaped his imprisonment in the Abyss.  Variant
now keeps watch over the gate, as it is rumored that he is a part of it. 
Since being destroyed in it's depths, some say that a fragment of his soul
remains within, linking him forever to the heart of the universe.  While
this explains his mastery of the portal, no one has ever proven this.

coincidence that the chain is just long enough that the locket rests against
your heart when worn.  In further concideration, you also realise the
convenient placement of the locket and wonder if it were intentional.

  pulsing with knowledge
  and glowing with power...
  And in that glow,

  we know
  and yet are decieved

  we thrive
  and yet we drown

  we grow
  and we are dwarfed

  we are alone
  and never lonely

  we are lost
  and we are found.

  a glimmer of laughter
  emerges from the depths of memory
  to brush his heart,
  before flickering away,
  leaving traces
  like threads of gold
  shimmering warmly in the darkness.

  Picking up the threads,
  he weaves them together --
  Together my friends.
  Forever my friends.

  And against the deepening darkness
  Echoing in my ears,
  The golden roar of a lion.

  Chill fingers of icy wind
  through open windows
  in the blackest night..
  brushing across his cheek

  in a comforting mask of ice;

  Take my hand
  and fear no longer
  Take my hand
  and cry no more..

which twinkles happily in a warm fireplace.  This is one of the many rooms
where the heroes and gods come to socialize.  It is by far one of the most

Draven's Hangout~
This room appears to be some sort of old-style office.  There is a large wall
of nothing but books on one wall.  In the corner is a roaring fireplace.  On
another wall there is a large cabinet full of liquors.  Next to the Giant
Skull Throne there are two books: the Holy Bible and a book of pure Evil. 
Strecthed across the floor in front of you, a large animal skin comforts your
knees as you kneel before the throne.  No doubt that this is Draven's room.

The Eye of the Hurricane~
The shrieking winds of a monstrous storm surround you, spinning you around
in an endless web of fury. But then, in the middle of turmoil, you find a
strange calm. You find yourself hovering in the calm eye of a hurricane. All
around you you can see the desruction caused by the powerful storm. White
hot flashes of lightning flicker from the depths of the hurricane.  But
everything is strangely peaceful in here, with the sun shining in from above
and a flock of birds winging across the sky.  You stretch out and relax, this
storm is going to be here a while.

Walking on the Moon~
The proud and lonely silence of Mare Imbrium surrounds you, as you gaze upon
the sterile splendor of the moon.  All around is the velvet curtain of night,
studded with a thousand gleaming jewels.  Below you hangs the beautiful
fields of Earth, looking fragile and far away, but full of hope.  A sense of
wistful regret touches you, as you think about what might have been, and what
will be.

The Satin Memorial Reading Room~
Half read books lie everywhere: Yeats, Tennyson, Chandler, Barrie;
a battered paperback de Laclos; a dusty leather-bound Donne.  A
damp novel perches precariously on the edge of a large bathtub.
As your eyes travel beyond the steam rising to the air toward the
rose-brambled balcony railing, you notice a well-creased printout
of a poem sitting on a the velvet cushions of a rosewood chair
that has been set so as to see the stark black mountains
from one angle, or the wine-dark sea from another.

stark black mountains wine wine-dark dark sea~
The ocean is constantly smashing up against the cliffs and rending
huge slabs from it.  The beach is scarcely a beach at all, more a
collection of rough flakes varying in size from a small car to a
small fist.  As the water comes up over the rocks and ebbs back
down, it filters through the spaces and makes an unnerving rattling
sound.

print out print-out creased well poem~
This page has been read over so many times that you can barely discern
the words, and in fact with much poring only the following becomes
clear:
        'I know that I am studly - Heck, I'm sexy, cute and cuddly
         And I know that I'm extremely modest too.'

The page it is flipped open to reads:

A sudden blow: the great wings beating still
Above the staggering girl, her thighs carressed
By the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,
he holds her helpless breast upon his breast.
How can those terrified vague fingers push
The feathered glory from her loosening thighs?
And how can body, laid in that white rush,
But feel that strange heart beating where it lies?
A shudder in the loins engenders there
The broken wall, the burning roof and tower
And Agammemnon dead.  Being so caught up,
So mastered by this brute blood of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge with his power
Before his indifferent beak could let her drop?

A copy of Peter Pan is opened near the end:

What sort of form was Hook showing?  Misguided man though he
was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in
the end he stayed true to the traditions of his race.  The
other boys were flying about him now, flouting, scornful; and
as he staggered about the deck striking at them impotently, his
mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing
fields of long ago, or being sent up for good, or watching
the wall-game from a famous wall.  And his shoes were right,
and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his
socks were right.

James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.

.       "My mariners
         Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me -
         The ever with a frolic welcome took
         The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
         Free hearts, free foreheads - you and I are old;
         Old age hath yet his honour and the toil
         Death closes all; but something ere the end,
         Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
         Not unbecoming of men that strove with the gods.
         The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;
         The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
         Moans round with many voices."

.       'One is very soon bored of everything, my angel; it is a law
        of nature.  It is not my fault.
        If, that is to say, that I am bored with an adventure that has
        claimed my attentions for four mortal months, it is not my fault.
        If, that is to say, my love is equal to your virtue - and that
        is certainly saying a great deal - it is not surprising that
        one should come to the end at the same time as the other.  It
        is not my fault.
        A woman that I love madly now insists that I give you up for
        her.  It is not my fault.
        I quite realize that this is the perfect opportunity to accuse
        me of perjury: but if, where nature has gifted men with no
        more than constancy, she has given women obstinacy, it is
        not my fault.
        Believe this, you should take another lover, even as I take
        another mistress.  This is good, very good advice: if you
        find it bad, it is not my fault.
        Good-bye, my angel.  I took you with pleasure, I leave you
        without regret.  I shall come back perhaps.  Such is life.
        It is not my fault.

Allanon's Cave of Relaxation and Meditation.~
You are in a small cave in a cliff next to a deep green sea.  Fine
gold and pink sand blanket the floor.  Shells are scattered and strewn
about.  A blow hole in the roof of the cave allows beams of light to stream
in and illuminate the cave.  The wind blows outside the entrance, but
you are protected from the weather in your cozy cave.  The foamy surf
never seems to quite reach your feet.  Several boulders here have been
worn by time into a shape similar to a comfortable chair.

The Archmage's Workroom~
This well-lit room is absolutely filled with clutter -- enchanting gear,
reagents, spell components, ancient tomes, scrolls, braziers, exotic incense
and countless other tools of the magical trade, all jumbled together with
seemingly no attention paid to organization.  You have no doubts that Alander
can find whatever he needs without delay, however.  A heavy oak door stands
barred to the south, to discourage idle visitors, and Alander's quarters
are east.

The scene lain before you is one that gives you the feeling of being placed
under a higher authority.  The jury is out.  A statue of Pontius Pilate is
in the aft of the Arena.  Staring balefully, the statue faces a distant
hillside where many aged crosses still stand.  The Arena is set in a wide
pit-like field of trampled bloodstained grass, and is guarded by high walls
of veinous marble.  A bloodstone seat awaits the true paragon of Romanity.

As the ancient oak door creeks open, you are blasted with a rush of stale
air.  Pushing the heavy door open, you step inside the massive room.  The
vast val- ted ceilings curve gracefully and meet in the center where a mural
stretches across the dome.  The mural is a depiction of the battle between
Thallin, God of Strife and his then false prophet, Palidor.  Directly below
the mural on the black and white marble tiled floor, is a large wooden desk.
The desk, what you can see of it, is a masterpiece.  With intricate carvings
depicting elves through the centuries.  On the desk, piled high, are all of
Thallin's projects thats need to be finished.  And, the pile overflows onto
the floor and throughout the room!  Behind the desk is a large, plush
throne.  The throne is carved of pure mithril and adorned in gold and
jewels.

up a wondrous potted tree which is bedecked with sugarplums, striped candies
and mints of all kinds.  Sensual thin spirals of incense bearing rich mystic
fragrances of patchuli, frankincense and myrrh weave magical patterns
through the air.  A wide fireplace is flanked by the bronzed nets of Neptune
which flow into a mantle over it.  Sitting on the mantle are various lovely

through one of the windows and you can see the second star to the right that

turn towards it.  There before you, on the wall, illuminating, is a
smokebox.  It looks like a terrible white box with souls writhing from its
shell.  As the whisps descend they form eyes.  Millions.  Dancing about,
looking at you.  Calling you.  Crying your name.  You try to look away but
cannot totally manage.  Instead, you now notice writing on the wall that you
could not see in the darkness.  It reads, 'There's a showdow just behind be,
shrouding every step I take, making every promise empty, pointing every
finger at me.  ' You finnaly control your eyes and look down.  You see a set
of lethal daggers.  Suddenly it comes to you.  This is where Remik dwells.
