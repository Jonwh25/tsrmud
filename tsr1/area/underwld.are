Dymeir mage~
Dymeir~
Dymeir, Lord of Darkness
~
Dymeir, ancient enemy of the Shaikari, leader of the lost race of Chaon. 
He seems to be a shadow given form, and darkness radiates from him,
seemingly flowing from his body.  The unrelenting darkness of his cloaked
face is pierced only by two dim yellow orbs which stare out from beneath the
hood at you.  Instinctively, you shiver as the eyes seem to peel away layer
after layer of your soul.  You feel something cold and slippery move in your
mind, as a low chuckle rolls out from unseen lips.

Cerebus~
Cerebus, the Wooden is here.
~
Cerebus whines too much and charms weak mobs to show off his prowess.  In
reality he is just plain annoying.  Although not entirely unlikable, he just
plain gets up your nose sometimes so you just have to stomp him.  But he
also uses the classic 'Zman Deletion Threat' gambit, which of course makes
him a target for ridicule.  Oh well.  Maybe someday he will grow up, and
learn to respect those around him.  We can only hope.

odysseus Bartender~
Odysseus~
Odysseus, Sacker of Cities is here happily tending bar.
~
After his many journeys across the changing world, Odysseus was
eventually elevated to a position of great honor among the gods.  Odysseus,
Sacker of Cities became Odysseus, Bartender of the Gods.  And an excellent
job he does as well.  He has to to keep the Norse happy with their wild
parties.  He often has to step in and break up fights between the noble Odin
and the usually drunk Zeus when Ra isn't around.  It takes a very brave man
to step between Odin and his quarry, not to mention to restrain a sloshed
Zeus.  He and Heimdall have much in common, and they frequently sing epic
songs together.  Odysseus of the nimble wit has proven his worth time and
again, and holds a place of great respect in the hearts of the Gods.

Nexus~
This room is constructed of a material similar in consistency and color
to a sand dollar.  It is strangely porous, and shaped in regular overlapping
layers that stretch from the ceiling to the floor.  The walls slope gently
down to meet the upturned floor, creating a flattened sphere with you at its
center.  Light seems to stream down from above, though there is no
discernable source.  There is no furniture, but the floor is slightly
spongy, creating a comfortable surface to sit upon.

Darkened Chamber~
This room is lit only by the shimmering gate that is at the center of the
chamber.  At the center of the circle of crumbling stones, the mystical
portal throws shifting shadows on the irregular walls.  It is as if the
stones are clutched by a gigantic shadowy hand, its sharp fingers
disappearing into the darkness of the high vaulted ceiling.  There is barely
enough light to pick out faded runes etched into the stones, ancient magic
that must be several centuries old.  The language is lost on you, as is the
function of this place.  There is a thick layer of dust upon the floor, and
it is certain that no one has disturbed this place for quite some time.  A
crude tunnel has been carved into the wall to the south, leading off into
the darkness.

Inside the Tunnel~
The tunnel seems to have been crudely carved by some sort of magical force,
for there are no signs of tunnel supports or irregular walls that would make
a manual excavation. The tunnel slopes slightly downwards to the south,
disappearing into darkness. To the north, the tunnel widens into a huge 
chamber, from which emanates a ghostly blue light.

The roughly hewn walls begin curving slightly west here, marking a turn

the curve to the south. To the north however, there is a strange blue glow
which throws faint shadows on the walls.

Curving Tunnel~
The tunnel curves in earnest here, disappearing into darkness to the west, 
and leading off to a faint glow to the north. The gentle bend in the tunnel
is perfect, adding further to the suspicion that the tunnel was excavated by
magical rather than manual means. There are still no signs of tunnel supports
or pick axe scrapings, so either the engineer who planned these catacombs was
brilliant, or he was a powerful wizard. The fact that the magic has lasted
for as long as these tunnels have existed is nothing short of astounding
and makes you wonder who was capable of such an amazing feat.

Sloping Tunnel~
The tunnel continues onward to the west, sloping downwards like a giant 
wormhole cut through the solid rock. Oddly, a cool wind can be felt lightly
upon your face, issuing forth from deeper within the earth. The air smells 
fresh, as opposed to the musty unfamiliarity of the remainder of the tunnel.
For some reason, your light source flickers, as if some magic of the tunnel
was interfering with it. The darkness intensifies as the catacombs continue.

Inside the Tunnel~
Your light source visibly dims as you enter this section of corridor.  It
is barely sufficient to illuminate a carving on the tunnel's wall.  It is a
large rune, approximately three hands across, and two hands high.  It is of
the same ancient tongue as the other inscriptions you have seen in these
chambers, and seems to radiate a raw magical force.  Your skin tightens and
itches slightly as the hairs on the back of your neck stand up on end.  The
catacombs continue to the east, and to the south, from which direction a
breeze lightly blows.  A dim light shines from a room to the north.  
~

E
rune~
The rune is about three hands wide, and two hands tall, though you hesitate
to touch it. It radiates raw magical force on a very basic, though extremely
powerful level. The ancient word may be a rune of binding, connecting the
enchantment to the tunnel, but without more evidence of the lost tongue, 
there is no way to be sure. The power, though aged is still amazingly strong.

Chamber of the Catacombs~
The tunnel widens slightly here, forming a chamber approximately six paces
across. There are several small shelves around the edge of the room, forming
platforms to sleep upon. This appears to be some sort of rest stop in the
subterannian passageways. Directly above your head, a glowing stone is set 
into the ceiling, its fading magic still faintly illuminating the chamber.
Around the border of the room, there is a three inch band of the ancient script
that is rampant in these tunnels. It circles the room, broken only by the 
room's entrance to the south.

A rumbling can be faintly felt through the walls and floor as you

wind that blows through the rest of the catacombs is swifter here, tugging
at your hair lightly as it blows from the west, and whispering through the
caverns to the north.

The rumbling has elevated to an audible level, a deep resounding noise that 
penetrates the rock of the tunnel, and the soles of your feet. It appears to
be coming from the west, where the tunnel continues into the darkness. Also
from this direction comes the breeze of fresh air that is such an anomoly in
this underground world. As a distinct opposite, nothing but silence can be 
detected from the passage to the east.

End of the Tunnel~
This room reverberates with the sounds of thunder, as if a herd of horses
were stampeding directly to the south. The sound is unending however, and there
is no way that mere horses could create this sort of power. The noise is 
near deafening, and blocks out all other noise in the tunnels. To the south
there is a crack in the wall, which glimmers with a dim light. The crack 
outlines the inside of a concealed door, on the other side of which lies the
source of the noise. Wind howls through the crack, pulling at your clothing
gently and streaming off down the corridor to the east.

Wall of Water~
Directly before you is a solid wall of falling water, whose spray quickly
soaks you to the bone. You are standing on a narrow ledge, about a handspan
wide, beyond which the water falls another sixty or seventy feet to an 
underground lake below. Such a fall would invariably be fatal, as would the
sudden stop at the end. On the wall to the east, there is a semi-regular 
series of small pits, that could easily serve as hand and foot holds without
drawing attention to themselves as being such. Unfortunately, hanging out
precariously above the water and using the holds, slick with spray from the
falls, is not a prospect which appeals to you.

Clinging to the Cavern Wall~
Precariously hanging from several concealed hand and footholds, your
surroundings are not foremost on your mind.  However, the scenery around you
is breathtaking.  The falls arc down from the west, falling a full two
hundred feet to the lake below.  Light streams from the fall's head,
illuminating the immense underground cavern that you are in.  Stalactites
hang from the ceiling and in some places stretch all the way to the lake's
bed, forming giant pillars that support the ceiling.  The cavern is several
hundred feet across, and seems to be spanned by a massive stone bridge which
begins on a cliff to the east.

Clinging to the Cavern Wall~
Your grip on the cavern wall is precarious, but firm. The pattern of hand
and footholds continues to the west towards the falls, and to the east to
a cliff from which an immense stone span arches out across the underground
lake, disappearing into the gloom at the other end of the cavern to the
south. Directly across from the span is a large archway, marking the opening
to a large tunnel which disappears into the cavern wall to the north.

The Edge of the Lake~
You stand atop a rocky ledge on the shore of an underground lake.  To the
west falls cascade two hundred feet to the lake below, throwing up a mist
that catches the sunlight as it streams down to light the waters depths. 
Directly to the south, an immense span of stone arches out over the lake,
supported by colossal pillars that juts from the lake's surface.  The span,
seemingly cut from a single stone, stretches several hundred feet to the
other side of the lake, where another tunnel disappears into the far wall. 
It is a marvel of construction, made with the same ancient magic as the rest
of the underworld.  The same magic responsible for the twelve foot archway
to the north, marking the opening of a vaulted passage that stretches away
from you into the cavern wall.

This corridor is twelve feet tall, and extends beyond the reach of your light
source's feeble illumination. The once smooth walls have been pitted and
scarred by all manner of instruments. In places, the ceiling has collapsed
into small piles of debris which partially block the corridor, but it is not
impassable. The tunnel continues to the north beyond the rubble, and seems to
be in no better shape. To the south, the corridor ends in a large open
cavern, lit by some overhead source.

Vaulted Corridor~
The corridor continues onward here, into the darkness to the north, and 
towards a dim light to the south. The corridor is strewn with rubble from 
collapsed portions of ceiling and walls, and the walls are pitted and scored
as if they had been subjected to bashing. In several places, there are large
runes that have been partially destroyed, their ancient etchings having lost
whatever power they might have had. Your light has diminished to the strength
of an evening sun, throwing long shadows in the echoing corridor.

Vaulted Corridor~
A thick dust has settled over every surface here, covering walls, floor
and rubble alike.  A huge mound of debris is piled against the west wall,
making passage through the corridor near impossible.  You must climb over
the mound, nearly touching the ceiling to get through.  The fact that your
light is only giving off as much light as a candle does not aid your footing
any.  The corridor continues into darkness to the north, and towards a
cavern to the south.

Collapsed Corridor~
The ceiling of the corridor has collapsed here, blocking the passage
completely. The walls are badly gouged and scratched, as if the destruction
were intentional. It seems that whoever caused this collapse, didn't want
whatever was on the other side to get out.. or didn't want anything on this
side to get in.

Roughly Hewn Tunnel~
This tunnel is less than four feet tall, and is obviously not of the same
construction as the rest of the corridor. This detour around the blockage was
hidden for some reason beneath the rubble, and twists through the rock
haphazardly. Whoever made this tunnel did not have the same resources as the
original creators. The tunnel winds away to the north.

Roughly Hewn Tunnel~
The hastily dug tunnel narrows to less than three feet here, forcing you
to crawl to continue.  The floor of the tunnel is littered with broken stone
and dust, making your passage uncomfortable at best.  The passage makes a
sharp turn, one end winding away to the west, the other disappearing to the
south.  The bend is so sharp, it requires several seconds of maneuvering to
work your armor and weapons through the corridor.

Roughly Hewn Tunnel~
The narrow tunnel curves sharply again here, one end disappearing to the
north, and the other to the south. The walls are rocky and are covered in all
manner of gouges and scrapes, layered over with a thick layer of dust and
dirt, and yet caked in dark lettering are words scrawled hastily in the
common tongue. The lettering appears to be done in blood.

Roughly Hewn Tunnel~
The tunnel bottlenecks here, narrowing to a passage barely three feet across,
and half again as tall. Added to the difficulty of passage, it makes a sharp
right angle turn here, forcing you to work your way around the corner to 
proceed. The tunnel widens to the east, forming a passage that bores through
the rock in a near perfect line. To the south, the passage narrows further,
and disappears around a corner.

Roughly Hewn Tunnel~
The tunnel continues here, winding deeper into the rock to the west, 
disappearing into the ominous darkness there. The tunnel narrows in that
direction, as if the rock itself was moving to prevent your passage. To the
east the tunnel bores a straight passage back towards the vaulted corridor.

Roughly Hewn Tunnel~
The tunnel seems to be a normal excavation, such as you would find in an
everyday mine. However, in this place of magic and grand structures, the plain
walls of the tunnel are somewhat of an oddity. At the very least they are
out of place, but what is the tunnel's function? The tunnel progresses
to the east and west, continuing deeper into the rock.

Roughly Hewn Tunnel~
A vague sensation of dread overcomes you for a moment as you pass into this
section of the tunnel, but it passes momentarily. Whether it was a
supernatural effect, or simply due to the prolonged constriction of the
tunnel, you do not know. The tunnel bores into the darkness of the rock
to the west. To the east, the tunnel ends in what appears to be a vaulted
corridor, of a much more ancient and ornamental design.

Vaulted Corridor~
The vaulted corridor that stretches away from you to the north, terminates
abruptly in a blockage that stretches from floor to ceiling, cutting off
this portion of the passage from the remainder to the south. The walls are
heavily pitted and gouged, as if the collapse of the ceiling were an 
intentional occurrence. On the wall is a large rune that has been partially
obliterated by what appears to be a clawed hand. Half buried under the 
rubble is a humanoid skeleton, one arm reaching back over its skull as if
trying to pull itself free. To the west is a rough tunnel that bores its
way into the rock, stretching out of sight.

Vaulted Corridor~
The vaulted corridor has an eerie stillness, as if it has been untouched by
time or the elements for many thousands of years. The air is stale, and the
floor is covered with a thin layer of dust that has remained undisturbed since
the collapse of the corridor to the south. Rubble has been strewn across the 
hall, both gouged from the walls of the corridor, and scattered from the
cave in. A thin layer of dust has settled over everything, and seems not to
have been disturbed for ages. On the floor before you are a pair of skeletons
locked in a mortal embrace. One still has a skeletal grip on the hilt of a 
rusted sword, that protrudes through the hollow ribcage of the other. The
second clutches the handle of a pick axe which has its point buried in the
first skeletons skull.

Vaulted Corridor~
The silence of the corridor is near complete, the air is totally stagnant.
There is no change, nothing to disturb the rest of the fallen that lie all
around you. Your steps echo in the massive corridor, breaking the eerie
stillness. The corridor stretches out to the south, and opens up into an
extremely dark room to the north. The skeletons seem to increase in number as
you move in that direction, falling off rapidly to the south.

Darkened Chamber~
This rougly circular chamber seems to be sapping the illumination of your
light source, throwing much of the chamber into total darkness.  From what
you can make out, the walls are covered with runes, most of which have been
obliterated.  Still standing in the center of the room are the broken
fragments of a stone circle, the twisted remnants of a once powerful magic. 
Scattered across the floor of the chamber are shards of the stone that have
been smashed by some force, destroying the focus for the gate.  The once
towering stone columns lie in ruin amidst the remnants of what appears to be
a great struggle.  Skeletons half buried amongst the rubble are clothed in
the remnants of their once strong armor, now mostly worn away by the sands
of time.  Their heraldry long since worn away, there is no clue as to the
cause of this battle, or who was it's eventual victor.  A vaulted corridor
stretches away from the cavern, leading to the south.

The skeleton with the shattered ribcage lies on the ground with one arm
outstretched over its skull. You notice that there is an object clutched in its
fleshless hand.

On the Span~
You are on a stone span that arcs out over the underground lake,
supported on great pillars of granite that disappear into the blue water
some eighty feet below.  Light from the waterfall's mouth illuminates your
path, and reveals the obvious age of the structure.  Luckily, it still seems
solid.  Along the edges of the bridge are narrow bands of the pervasive
runes that the ancient builders inscribed on all of their handiwork.

On the Span~
You stand at the highest point in the massive arch of stone, and from
your position, the view of the lake is breathtaking.  The lake laps gently
against the stone supports approzimately a hundred feet below you.  The
stone seems not to have eroded even slightly, despite the many years of wear
they must have suffered.  It is a testament to the impressive skills of the
lost race of the Underworld.  The span continues to the north and south, the
underground highway disappearing in both directions into a solid wall of
rock.

The Tavern of the Gods~
This room is filled with immortals of various pantheons.  Thor shares a
tankard of ale with Dionysis while Set and Osiris play darts against
Heimdall and Shiva.  At the far wall, Odysseus is behind the bar mixing
drinks for the heavenly hosts.  Ra steps between an angry Odin and a drunk
Zeus, attempting to prevent a horrible altercation, and Raiden and Athena
drag a drunk Bacchus from the establishment, while Hermes looks on shaking
his head.

Prison of the Damned~
This room is composed of the meshing of stactites and stalagmites grown
together after countless aeons.  It creates the uncomfortable effect of jaws
closed around you.  There are faint noises of water dripping and the echoes
of bats in the distance.  There is no visible door and the space between the
rocks is far too small to squeeze through.  It seems that you are trapped.

The Armory~
This room is dark except for the lit weapons and armor that are on
display on the walls.  The raiments of war are obviously ancient, though
seem to be in excellent repair.  You are unsure if this is a museum, or if
these objects are actually used by someone.  The glittering metal of swords
and armor all bear unfamiliar heraldry, and long forgotten runes of power. 
There is a sense of a great latent force here, which emanates from the
darkness around you.  All in all, this place is as unnerving as it is
fascinating.
