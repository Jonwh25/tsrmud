I. INTRODUCTION TO MOBPROGRAMS.

	Welcome to the OLC building document for TSR MUD. I did not want to 
recreate the wheel and I will not attempt to rewrite the already written 
Mobprogram document. You will need the mobprog doc and read it and understand
it first before you attempt to use the OLC for MOBProgs on TSR. 
	It is my goal and my hope that this document will clarify how to
use MOBProgs in OLC to incorporate your ideas. Now please understand that
you have been given a very unique and powerful command. Not everyone will
get to use this command. So feel honored. 
	Lets start this... Once again I suggest you write down all your 
ideas...and more importantly have the code you want to add already 
written down on a piece of paper. So sit back drink an ice cold beer and 
lets get busy. 

II. GETTING STARTED.

	First things first...You HAVE TO have read the mobprog document. If
you have read it and understand how it works then read on. ALSO you will
have to know how the TSR OLC works for standard OLC: ie, mobs, objs, rooms,
resets, etc. 
	Now that you have all of this understood and done then find your
favorite beer bong and bong your favorite brand of beer. You deserved that!
Good job! Hope your head is spinning now and if not...well, keep reading,
it will be by the end of this document! heh.
	Write down ALL of your code that you plan on creating with OLC on
a piece of paper. Now how this works is this. You use the area vnums for YOUR
area as vnums. So lets say you have made a mob vnum 8600...the mobprog that
you should have is 8600 for the mobprog...or at least start with your vnums. 
This way the mobprogs aren't scattered everywhere.


III. COMMANDS AND HOW TO USE THEM.

Here is a listing of the commands: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpdump                           mpedit                             mplist
mpsave                           mpstat
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Now I will use the same way of describing these commands as I did
in my OLC document. This makes a very nice manual...and its even readable 
unless your already drunk...and I guess that makes you a LIGHTWEIGHT! heh.

1.) mpdump [vnum]
    Ex: mpdump 8600

	This command will simply "dump" the contents of the mobprog to
your screen. It will display the "mobprog code". Very handy...

2.) mplist

	This command simply lists all of the mobprogs on the MUD. Its very
useful for looking to see if that vnum is taken or not before you begin.

3.) mpstat [mobname]
    Ex: mpstat puff

	This command will simply show what mobprog vnum is on that mob.

4.) mpedit 
           - vnum
	   - create vnum
    
    Ex1: mpedit 8600
    Ex2: mpedit create 8600

	This is the heart and soul of the olc for mobprogs. It is here you 
will enter that code that you have written out. Its very simple to use. Inside
this editor you will find the usual commands, show, and ? commands. You will
also see the desc command. Simply type desc once inside the editor and type
out your mobprog code. Be warned: Do not format it. It all works the same
as the usual olc. 

5.) mpsave

	When your done with each mobprog code you have made simply type mpsave.
This will save the code you have just wrote. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Now your saying COOL! That wasn't hard at all! Well its time for you
to pull out that favorite beer bong again and bong another beer. If your a
fast drinker you should probably have drank at least 4 beers by now. 1 beer
while reading the intro and then you bonged a beer, drank one while reading
the commands and now you have bonged another. I hope your feeling somewhat
amused. I know I am.
 	Now comes the fun part. We get to add the mobprog code you just made
to a mob! Woo hoo! Fire up the mobprog editor on the mob you want to add the
mobprog code to and lets get busy. Within the mob editor you will find two
commands as follows: addmprog and delmprog. 

1.) addmprog [vnum] [trigger] [phrase]

	Here ya are...You should know what each of these things are from
reading the mobprog document. If you forget what all the triggers are simply
type ? mpflag. Here are the flags for you just in case you want to refrence
them here:
	
act	 		bribe   		death   		entry
fight			give			greet			grall
kill			hpcnt			random			speech
exit			exall			delay			surr

2.) delmprog #

	This is really easy...when you do a show from inside your mob editor
you will see the mobprog code section and simply type the number you want to
delete from the mob.


	Congrats! You have just mastered OLC for mobprogs! BONG ANOTHER BEER! 
You should now be able to add mobprograms to TSR using OLC.

IV. CLOSING WORDS FROM THE AUTHOR.

	Well lets hope that you understand all of this and can say, "hey!
Beo, you did a kick ass job on this document! I learned MOBProg OLC for
TSR and I got drunk as well!" If you have any questions or feel that I 
need to add anything or forgot something please feel free to let me know
by emailing me at beowolf@moon.mat.net or drop by TSR: realms.mat.net 9000.
Take care and finish off your beer!
