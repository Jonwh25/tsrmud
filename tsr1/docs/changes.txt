ILAB OLC Beta 1.0

Apr. 07 1995

These are some of the changes that I have made to this version of OLC.
Notice that I will not be keeping a running tally of repairs I have
made.  I will only included changes that have been made since the last
version I released.

Changes:
) When removing the last builder from the list, he is replaced by "None".
) Many superfluous functions were removed.
) NULL removed to keep code looking Envy-esque.
) Memory problems fixed. (str_dup used in create_mob/obj)
) Resets now show just those in the room.
) Randomized exits allowed.
) Multiple flags may be entered on one line.  Thanks Russ Taylor.
) Vnum range is syntax checked.
) Minimal filename syntax checking.
) Table lookup for spec_funs and stats and flags.
) New display format for all editors.
) Fix to close_socket by Talen added, then removed again when code revised.
) Table lookup for commands.
) Command dump of editor commands to user added.
) Fixed the Who command, now it displays editing characters, then removed
  again when code revised.
) Added C flag to complement c flag for prompts by showing vnum being edited.
) Used new table format to display current flags, stats, spells,
  special functions.
) Rewrote help.
) Save routines now check for builder authorization and asave area, for
  example, finds the area of the currently edited object/mobile and saves only
  that area.  Before it would save the area that the player was physically
  standing in even if editing in another area at that time.
) editing no longer crashes game when it becomes too large.
) used last line skipping(as in CircleMUD) instead of truncation.
) ensured that strings entered via the editor cannot have '~' in them.
) revised secutiry levels, now 0 is lowest, and there in no upper limit.
  Areas are loaded with a security of 1 if they don't have a security
  value set.  This means that beginning players (security=0) will not
  be able to edit them.
) Objects can be created and get saved in player files and still be
  loaded even if the database doesn't get saved.
) fix all d->connected checks.  By changing the configuration of
  olc this became unnecessary.  Connected states for editors are now
  internalized.
) tilde no longer used in SEdit.  Smash_tilde() called at the beginning
  if string_add so that .r "hello" "he~lo" is not allowed.  Thanks to
  James Seng for noticing this.
) removed the light command for rooms because it isn't saved in the
  database.
) list "key" etc for just working area.
   list mob <shop>, <spec (spec_name)>, <level (#)>, <name (name)>
            <sex (letter)>, <align (number)>
   list obj <type (? types)>, <name (name)>
   list room
